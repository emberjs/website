  <h3>Clearing Completed Todos (cont)</h3>

  <p>We've defined an instance of <code>SC.Button</code> that calls a method on
  an object when it is clicked. In this case we've told the button to call the
  <code>clearCompletedTodos</code> method (its action) on the
  <code>Todos.todosController</code> object (its target).</p>

  <p>We've also told it to add an <code>is-active</code> class to the view when
  it is clicked or tapped. Every <code>SC.Button</code> has an
  <code>isActive</code> property that will be <code>true</code> when it is in
  the process of being clicked. This allows us to display a visual cue to the
  user that they have hit the right target.</p>

  <p>Try it out: add some todos, then mark them done and clear them. Because we
  previously bound the visual list to the <code>todosController</code>, making
  a change through the action has the expected effect.</p>
