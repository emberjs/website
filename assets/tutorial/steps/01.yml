  <p><strong>Here are the two key features that make Ember so powerful:</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Bindings:</strong> Bindings create a bidirectional link between two properties. If the property of one
  object changes, the property on the other object updates automatically.</p>

  <p><strong>Computed Properties</strong>: Computed properties allow you to treat a function as a property. This allows
  you to synthesize a new property from multiple input properties, and have it update automatically any time one of
  those input properties changes.</p>

  <p>This tutorial will show you how to use these two concepts to build a todo app with astonishingly little code.</p>
