  <h3>The More You Know (cont)</h3>

  <p>Ok, that works, but it would be more useful to know how many items we have left, not just how many we have total.
  Let's add a property called 'remaining' to our controller to tell us how many undone items there are.</p>

  <p>Here, we specify our dependent key using @each. This allows us to depend on properties of the array’s items. In
  this case, we want to update the remaining property any time isDone changes on a Todo. We'll also be notified when an
  item is added to or removed from the array.</p>

  <p>It’s important to declare dependent keys because Ember uses this information to know when to update bindings.
  In our case, our StatsView updates any time todosController’s remaining property changes.</p>

  <p>We'll add the following to our todosController after the <code>content: []</code> line.</p>

codeTarget: 'javascript'

code: |
  remaining: function() {
    return this.filterProperty('isDone', false).get('length');
  }.property('@each.isDone'),

# We may want to make this matcher more specific
