      The `ApplicationInstance` encapsulates all of the stateful aspects of a
      running `Application`.

      At a high-level, we break application boot into two distinct phases:

      * Definition time, where all of the classes, templates, and other
        dependencies are loaded (typically in the browser).
      * Run time, where we begin executing the application once everything
        has loaded.

      Definition time can be expensive and only needs to happen once since it is
      an idempotent operation. For example, between test runs and FastBoot
      requests, the application stays the same. It is only the state that we want
      to reset.

      That state is what the `ApplicationInstance` manages: it is responsible for
      creating the container that contains all application state, and disposing of
      it once the particular test run or FastBoot request has finished.

      The `ContainerDebugAdapter` helps the container and resolver interface
      with tools that debug Ember such as the
      [Ember Extension](https://github.com/tildeio/ember-extension)
      for Chrome and Firefox.

      This class can be extended by a custom resolver implementer
      to override some of the methods with library-specific code.

      The methods likely to be overridden are:

      * `canCatalogEntriesByType`
      * `catalogEntriesByType`

      The adapter will need to be registered
      in the application's container as `container-debug-adapter:main`.

      Example:

      ```javascript
      Application.initializer({
        name: "containerDebugAdapter",

        initialize(application) {
          application.register('container-debug-adapter:main', require('app/container-debug-adapter'));

      The internal class used to create text inputs when the `{{input}}`
      helper is used with `type` of `checkbox`.

      See [Ember.Templates.helpers.input](/api/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers.html#method_input)  for usage details.

      ## Direct manipulation of `checked`

      The `checked` attribute of an `Ember.Checkbox` object should always be set
      through the Ember object or by interacting with its rendered element
      representation via the mouse, keyboard, or touch. Updating the value of the
      checkbox via jQuery will result in the checked value of the object and its
      element losing synchronization.

      ## Layout and LayoutName properties

      Because HTML `input` elements are self closing `layout` and `layoutName`
      properties will not be applied. See [Ember.View](/api/classes/Ember.View.html)'s
      layout section for more information.

      [Glimmer](https://github.com/tildeio/glimmer) is a [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)
      compatible templating engine used by Ember.js.
      Any valid Handlebars syntax is valid in an Ember template.

      ### Showing a property

      Templates manage the flow of an application's UI, and display state (through
      the DOM) to a user. For example, given a component with the property "name",
      that component's template can use the name in several ways:

      ```javascript
        // app/components/person.js
        export default Ember.Component.extend({
          name: 'Jill'
        });
      ```

      ```handlebars
      {{! app/components/person.hbs }}
      {{name}}
      <div>{{name}}</div>
      <span data-name={{name}}></span>
      ```

      Any time the "name" property on the component changes, the DOM will be
      updated.

      Properties can be chained as well:

      ```handlebars
      {{aUserModel.name}}
      <div>{{listOfUsers.firstObject.name}}</div>
      ```

      ### Using Ember helpers

      When content is passed in mustaches `{{}}`, Ember will first try to find a helper
      or component with that name. For example, the `if` helper:

      ```handlebars
      {{if name "I have a name" "I have no name"}}
      <span data-has-name={{if name true}}></span>
      ```

      The returned value is placed where the `{{}}` is called. The above style is
      called "inline". A second style of helper usage is called "block". For example:

      ```handlebars
      {{#if name}}
      I have a name
      {{else}}
      I have no name
      {{/if}}
      ```

      The block form of helpers allows you to control how the UI is created based
      on the values of properties.
      A third form of helper is called "nested". For example here the concat
      helper will add " Doe" to a displayed name if the person has no last name:

      ```handlebars
      <span data-name={{concat firstName (
      if lastName (concat " " lastName) "Doe"
      )}}></span>
      ```

      Ember's built-in helpers are described under the [Ember.Templates.helpers](/api/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers.html)
      namespace. Documentation on creating custom helpers can be found under
      [Ember.Helper](/api/classes/Ember.Helper.html).

      ### Invoking a Component

      Ember components represent state to the UI of an application. Further
      reading on components can be found under [Ember.Component](/api/classes/Ember.Component.html).

      Ember.Location returns an instance of the correct implementation of
      the `location` API.

      ## Implementations

      You can pass an implementation name (`hash`, `history`, `none`) to force a
      particular implementation to be used in your application.

      ### HashLocation

      Using `HashLocation` results in URLs with a `#` (hash sign) separating the
      server side URL portion of the URL from the portion that is used by Ember.
      This relies upon the `hashchange` event existing in the browser.

      Example:

      ```javascript
      App.Router.map(function() {
        this.route('posts', function() {
          this.route('new');
        });
      });

      App.Router.reopen({
        location: 'hash'
      });
      ```

      This will result in a posts.new url of `/#/posts/new`.

      ### HistoryLocation

      Using `HistoryLocation` results in URLs that are indistinguishable from a
      standard URL. This relies upon the browser's `history` API.

      Example:

      ```javascript
      App.Router.map(function() {
        this.route('posts', function() {
          this.route('new');
        });
      });

      App.Router.reopen({
        location: 'history'
      });
      ```

      This will result in a posts.new url of `/posts/new`.

      Keep in mind that your server must serve the Ember app at all the routes you
      define.

      ### AutoLocation

      Using `AutoLocation`, the router will use the best Location class supported by
      the browser it is running in.

      Browsers that support the `history` API will use `HistoryLocation`, those that
      do not, but still support the `hashchange` event will use `HashLocation`, and
      in the rare case neither is supported will use `NoneLocation`.

      Example:

      ```javascript
      App.Router.map(function() {
        this.route('posts', function() {
          this.route('new');
        });
      });

      App.Router.reopen({
        location: 'auto'
      });
      ```

      This will result in a posts.new url of `/posts/new` for modern browsers that
      support the `history` api or `/#/posts/new` for older ones, like Internet
      Explorer 9 and below.

      When a user visits a link to your application, they will be automatically
      upgraded or downgraded to the appropriate `Location` class, with the URL
      transformed accordingly, if needed.

      Keep in mind that since some of your users will use `HistoryLocation`, your
      server must serve the Ember app at all the routes you define.

      ### NoneLocation

      Using `NoneLocation` causes Ember to not store the applications URL state
      in the actual URL. This is generally used for testing purposes, and is one
      of the changes made when calling `App.setupForTesting()`.

      ## Location API

      Each location implementation must provide the following methods:

      * implementation: returns the string name used to reference the implementation.
      * getURL: returns the current URL.
      * setURL(path): sets the current URL.
      * replaceURL(path): replace the current URL (optional).
      * onUpdateURL(callback): triggers the callback when the URL changes.
      * formatURL(url): formats `url` to be placed into `href` attribute.
      * detect() (optional): instructs the location to do any feature detection
          necessary. If the location needs to redirect to a different URL, it
          can cancel routing by setting the `cancelRouterSetup` property on itself
          to `false`.

      Calling setURL or replaceURL will not trigger onUpdateURL callbacks.

      ## Custom implementation

      Ember scans `app/locations/*` for extending the Location API.

      Example:

      ```javascript
      import Ember from 'ember';

      export default Ember.HistoryLocation.extend({
        implementation: 'history-url-logging',

        pushState: function (path) {
          console.log(path);
          this._super.apply(this, arguments);
        }
      });
      ```

      An instance of `Ember.Application` is the starting point for every Ember
      application. It helps to instantiate, initialize and coordinate the many
      objects that make up your app.

      Each Ember app has one and only one `Ember.Application` object. In fact, the
      very first thing you should do in your application is create the instance:

      ```javascript
      window.App = Ember.Application.create();
      ```

      Typically, the application object is the only global variable. All other
      classes in your app should be properties on the `Ember.Application` instance,
      which highlights its first role: a global namespace.

      For example, if you define a view class, it might look like this:

      ```javascript
      App.MyView = Ember.View.extend();
      ```

      By default, calling `Ember.Application.create()` will automatically initialize
      your application by calling the `Ember.Application.initialize()` method. If
      you need to delay initialization, you can call your app's `deferReadiness()`
      method. When you are ready for your app to be initialized, call its
      `advanceReadiness()` method.

      You can define a `ready` method on the `Ember.Application` instance, which
      will be run by Ember when the application is initialized.

      Because `Ember.Application` inherits from `Ember.Namespace`, any classes
      you create will have useful string representations when calling `toString()`.
      See the `Ember.Namespace` documentation for more information.

      While you can think of your `Ember.Application` as a container that holds the
      other classes in your application, there are several other responsibilities
      going on under-the-hood that you may want to understand.

      ### Event Delegation

      Ember uses a technique called _event delegation_. This allows the framework
      to set up a global, shared event listener instead of requiring each view to
      do it manually. For example, instead of each view registering its own
      `mousedown` listener on its associated element, Ember sets up a `mousedown`
      listener on the `body`.

      If a `mousedown` event occurs, Ember will look at the target of the event and
      start walking up the DOM node tree, finding corresponding views and invoking
      their `mouseDown` method as it goes.

      `Ember.Application` has a number of default events that it listens for, as
      well as a mapping from lowercase events to camel-cased view method names. For
      example, the `keypress` event causes the `keyPress` method on the view to be
      called, the `dblclick` event causes `doubleClick` to be called, and so on.

      If there is a bubbling browser event that Ember does not listen for by
      default, you can specify custom events and their corresponding view method
      names by setting the application's `customEvents` property:

      ```javascript
      let App = Ember.Application.create({
        customEvents: {
          // add support for the paste event
          paste: 'paste'
        }
      });
      ```

      To prevent Ember from setting up a listener for a default event,
      specify the event name with a `null` value in the `customEvents`
      property:

      ```javascript
      let App = Ember.Application.create({
        customEvents: {
          // prevent listeners for mouseenter/mouseleave events
          mouseenter: null,
          mouseleave: null
        }
      });
      ```

      By default, the application sets up these event listeners on the document
      body. However, in cases where you are embedding an Ember application inside
      an existing page, you may want it to set up the listeners on an element
      inside the body.

      For example, if only events inside a DOM element with the ID of `ember-app`
      should be delegated, set your application's `rootElement` property:

      ```javascript
      let App = Ember.Application.create({
        rootElement: '#ember-app'
      });
      ```

      The `rootElement` can be either a DOM element or a jQuery-compatible selector
      string. Note that *views appended to the DOM outside the root element will
      not receive events.* If you specify a custom root element, make sure you only
      append views inside it!

      To learn more about the events Ember components use, see
      [components/handling-events](https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.6.0/components/handling-events/#toc_event-names).

      ### Initializers

      Libraries on top of Ember can add initializers, like so:

      ```javascript
      Ember.Application.initializer({
        name: 'api-adapter',

        initialize: function(application) {
          application.register('api-adapter:main', ApiAdapter);
        }
      });
      ```

      Initializers provide an opportunity to access the internal registry, which
      organizes the different components of an Ember application. Additionally
      they provide a chance to access the instantiated application. Beyond
      being used for libraries, initializers are also a great way to organize
      dependency injection or setup in your own application.

      ### Routing

      In addition to creating your application's router, `Ember.Application` is
      also responsible for telling the router when to start routing. Transitions
      between routes can be logged with the `LOG_TRANSITIONS` flag, and more
      detailed intra-transition logging can be logged with
      the `LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL` flag:

      ```javascript
      let App = Ember.Application.create({
        LOG_TRANSITIONS: true, // basic logging of successful transitions
        LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL: true // detailed logging of all routing steps
      });
      ```

      By default, the router will begin trying to translate the current URL into
      application state once the browser emits the `DOMContentReady` event. If you
      need to defer routing, you can call the application's `deferReadiness()`
      method. Once routing can begin, call the `advanceReadiness()` method.

      If there is any setup required before routing begins, you can implement a
      `ready()` method on your app that will be invoked immediately before routing
      begins.

    description: |-
      The DefaultResolver defines the default lookup rules to resolve
      container lookups before consulting the container for registered
      items:

      * templates are looked up on `Ember.TEMPLATES`
      * other names are looked up on the application after converting
        the name. For example, `controller:post` looks up
        `App.PostController` by default.
      * there are some nuances (see examples below)

      ### How Resolving Works

      The container calls this object's `resolve` method with the
      `fullName` argument.

      It first parses the fullName into an object using `parseName`.

      Then it checks for the presence of a type-specific instance
      method of the form `resolve[Type]` and calls it if it exists.
      For example if it was resolving 'template:post', it would call
      the `resolveTemplate` method.

      Its last resort is to call the `resolveOther` method.

      The methods of this object are designed to be easy to override
      in a subclass. For example, you could enhance how a template
      is resolved like so:

      ```javascript
      App = Ember.Application.create({
        Resolver: Ember.DefaultResolver.extend({
          resolveTemplate: function(parsedName) {
            let resolvedTemplate = this._super(parsedName);
            if (resolvedTemplate) { return resolvedTemplate; }
            return Ember.TEMPLATES['not_found'];
          }
        })
      });
      ```

      Some examples of how names are resolved:

      ```
      'template:post'           //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['post']
      'template:posts/byline'   //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['posts/byline']
      'template:posts.byline'   //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['posts/byline']
      'template:blogPost'       //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['blogPost']
                                //   OR
                                //   Ember.TEMPLATES['blog_post']
      'controller:post'         //=> App.PostController
      'controller:posts.index'  //=> App.PostsIndexController
      'controller:blog/post'    //=> Blog.PostController
      'controller:basic'        //=> Ember.Controller
      'route:post'              //=> App.PostRoute
      'route:posts.index'       //=> App.PostsIndexRoute
      'route:blog/post'         //=> Blog.PostRoute
      'route:basic'             //=> Ember.Route
      'view:post'               //=> App.PostView
      'view:posts.index'        //=> App.PostsIndexView
      'view:blog/post'          //=> Blog.PostView
      'view:basic'              //=> Ember.View

      An `Ember.Component` is a view that is completely
      isolated. Properties accessed in its templates go
      to the view object and actions are targeted at
      the view object. There is no access to the
      surrounding context or outer controller; all
      contextual information must be passed in.

      The easiest way to create an `Ember.Component` is via
      a template. If you name a template
      `components/my-foo`, you will be able to use
      `{{my-foo}}` in other templates, which will make
      an instance of the isolated component.

      ```handlebars
      {{app-profile person=currentUser}}
      ```

      ```handlebars
      <!-- app-profile template -->
      <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>
      <img src={{person.avatar}}>
      <p class='signature'>{{person.signature}}</p>
      ```

      You can use `yield` inside a template to
      include the **contents** of any block attached to
      the component. The block will be executed in the
      context of the surrounding context or outer controller:

      ```handlebars
      {{#app-profile person=currentUser}}
        <p>Admin mode</p>
        {{! Executed in the controller's context. }}
      {{/app-profile}}
      ```

      ```handlebars
      <!-- app-profile template -->
      <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>
      {{! Executed in the component's context. }}
      {{yield}} {{! block contents }}
      ```

      If you want to customize the component, in order to
      handle events or actions, you implement a subclass
      of `Ember.Component` named after the name of the
      component. Note that `Component` needs to be appended to the name of
      your subclass like `AppProfileComponent`.

      For example, you could implement the action
      `hello` for the `app-profile` component:

      ```javascript
      App.AppProfileComponent = Ember.Component.extend({
        actions: {
          hello: function(name) {
            console.log("Hello", name);
          }
        }
      });
      ```

      And then use it in the component's template:

      ```handlebars
      <!-- app-profile template -->
      <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>
      {{yield}} <!-- block contents -->
      <button {{action 'hello' person.name}}>
        Say Hello to {{person.name}}
      </button>
      ```
      Components must have a `-` in their name to avoid
      conflicts with built-in controls that wrap HTML
      elements. This is consistent with the same
      requirement in web components.

      Ember Helpers are functions that can compute values, and are used in templates.
      For example, this code calls a helper named `format-currency`:

      ```handlebars
      <div>{{format-currency cents currency="$"}}</div>
      ```

      Additionally a helper can be called as a nested helper (sometimes called a
      subexpression). In this example, the computed value of a helper is passed
      to a component named `show-money`:

      ```handlebars
      {{show-money amount=(format-currency cents currency="$")}}
      ```

      Helpers defined using a class must provide a `compute` function. For example:

      ```js
      export default Ember.Helper.extend({
        compute(params, hash) {
          let cents = params[0];
          let currency = hash.currency;
          return `${currency}${cents * 0.01}`;
        }
      });
      ```

      Each time the input to a helper changes, the `compute` function will be
      called again.

      As instances, these helpers also have access to the container an will accept
      injected dependencies.

      Additionally, class helpers can call `recompute` to force a new computation.

      An `Ember.Binding` connects the properties of two objects so that whenever
      the value of one property changes, the other property will be changed also.

      ## Automatic Creation of Bindings with `/^*Binding/`-named Properties.

      You do not usually create Binding objects directly but instead describe
      bindings in your class or object definition using automatic binding
      detection.

      Properties ending in a `Binding` suffix will be converted to `Ember.Binding`
      instances. The value of this property should be a string representing a path
      to another object or a custom binding instance created using Binding helpers
      (see "One Way Bindings"):

      ```
      valueBinding: "MyApp.someController.title"
      ```

      This will create a binding from `MyApp.someController.title` to the `value`
      property of your object instance automatically. Now the two values will be
      kept in sync.

      ## One Way Bindings

      One especially useful binding customization you can use is the `oneWay()`
      helper. This helper tells Ember that you are only interested in
      receiving changes on the object you are binding from. For example, if you
      are binding to a preference and you want to be notified if the preference
      has changed, but your object will not be changing the preference itself, you
      could do:

      ```
      bigTitlesBinding: Ember.Binding.oneWay("MyApp.preferencesController.bigTitles")
      ```

      This way if the value of `MyApp.preferencesController.bigTitles` changes the
      `bigTitles` property of your object will change also. However, if you
      change the value of your `bigTitles` property, it will not update the
      `preferencesController`.

      One way bindings are almost twice as fast to setup and twice as fast to
      execute because the binding only has to worry about changes to one side.

      You should consider using one way bindings anytime you have an object that
      may be created frequently and you do not intend to change a property; only
      to monitor it for changes (such as in the example above).

      ## Adding Bindings Manually

      All of the examples above show you how to configure a custom binding, but the
      result of these customizations will be a binding template, not a fully active
      Binding instance. The binding will actually become active only when you
      instantiate the object the binding belongs to. It is useful, however, to
      understand what actually happens when the binding is activated.

      For a binding to function it must have at least a `from` property and a `to`
      property. The `from` property path points to the object/key that you want to
      bind from while the `to` path points to the object/key you want to bind to.

      When you define a custom binding, you are usually describing the property
      you want to bind from (such as `MyApp.someController.value` in the examples
      above). When your object is created, it will automatically assign the value
      you want to bind `to` based on the name of your binding key. In the
      examples above, during init, Ember objects will effectively call
      something like this on your binding:

      ```javascript
      binding = Ember.Binding.from("valueBinding").to("value");
      ```

      This creates a new binding instance based on the template you provide, and
      sets the to path to the `value` property of the new object. Now that the
      binding is fully configured with a `from` and a `to`, it simply needs to be
      connected to become active. This is done through the `connect()` method:

      ```javascript
      binding.connect(this);
      ```

      Note that when you connect a binding you pass the object you want it to be
      connected to. This object will be used as the root for both the from and
      to side of the binding when inspecting relative paths. This allows the
      binding to be automatically inherited by subclassed objects as well.

      This also allows you to bind between objects using the paths you declare in
      `from` and `to`:

      ```javascript
      // Example 1
      binding = Ember.Binding.from("App.someObject.value").to("value");
      binding.connect(this);

      // Example 2
      binding = Ember.Binding.from("parentView.value").to("App.someObject.value");
      binding.connect(this);
      ```

      Now that the binding is connected, it will observe both the from and to side
      and relay changes.

      If you ever needed to do so (you almost never will, but it is useful to
      understand this anyway), you could manually create an active binding by
      using the `Ember.bind()` helper method. (This is the same method used by
      to setup your bindings on objects):

      ```javascript
      Ember.bind(MyApp.anotherObject, "value", "MyApp.someController.value");
      ```

      Both of these code fragments have the same effect as doing the most friendly
      form of binding creation like so:

      ```javascript
      MyApp.anotherObject = Ember.Object.create({
        valueBinding: "MyApp.someController.value",

        // OTHER CODE FOR THIS OBJECT...
      });
      ```

      Ember's built in binding creation method makes it easy to automatically
      create bindings for you. You should always use the highest-level APIs
      available, even if you understand how it works underneath.

      A computed property transforms an object literal with object's accessor function(s) into a property.

      By default the function backing the computed property will only be called
      once and the result will be cached. You can specify various properties
      that your computed property depends on. This will force the cached
      result to be recomputed if the dependencies are modified.

      In the following example we declare a computed property - `fullName` - by calling
      `.Ember.computed()` with property dependencies (`firstName` and `lastName`) as leading arguments and getter accessor function. The `fullName` getter function
      will be called once (regardless of how many times it is accessed) as long
      as its dependencies have not changed. Once `firstName` or `lastName` are updated
      any future calls (or anything bound) to `fullName` will incorporate the new
      values.

      ```javascript
      let Person = Ember.Object.extend({
        // these will be supplied by `create`
        firstName: null,
        lastName: null,

        fullName: Ember.computed('firstName', 'lastName', function() {
          let firstName = this.get('firstName'),
              lastName  = this.get('lastName');

          return firstName + ' ' + lastName;
        })
      });

      let tom = Person.create({
        firstName: 'Tom',
        lastName: 'Dale'
      });

      tom.get('fullName') // 'Tom Dale'
      ```

      You can also define what Ember should do when setting a computed property by providing additional function (`set`) in hash argument.
      If you try to set a computed property, it will try to invoke setter accessor function with the key and
      value you want to set it to as arguments.

      ```javascript
      let Person = Ember.Object.extend({
        // these will be supplied by `create`
        firstName: null,
        lastName: null,

        fullName: Ember.computed('firstName', 'lastName', {
          get(key) {
            let firstName = this.get('firstName'),
                lastName  = this.get('lastName');

            return firstName + ' ' + lastName;
          },
          set(key, value) {
            let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(' ');

            this.set('firstName', firstName);
            this.set('lastName', lastName);

            return value;
          }
        })
      });

      let person = Person.create();

      person.set('fullName', 'Peter Wagenet');
      person.get('firstName'); // 'Peter'
      person.get('lastName');  // 'Wagenet'
      ```

      You can overwrite computed property with normal property (no longer computed), that won't change if dependencies change, if you set computed property and it won't have setter accessor function defined.

      You can also mark computed property as `.readOnly()` and block all attempts to set it.

      ```javascript
      let Person = Ember.Object.extend({
        // these will be supplied by `create`
        firstName: null,
        lastName: null,

        fullName: Ember.computed('firstName', 'lastName', {
          get(key) {
            let firstName = this.get('firstName');
            let lastName  = this.get('lastName');

            return firstName + ' ' + lastName;
          }
        }).readOnly()
      });

      let person = Person.create();
      person.set('fullName', 'Peter Wagenet'); // Uncaught Error: Cannot set read-only property "fullName" on object: <(...):emberXXX>
      ```

      This helper returns a new property descriptor that wraps the passed
      computed property function. You can use this helper to define properties
      with mixins or via `Ember.defineProperty()`.

      If you pass a function as an argument, it will be used as a getter. A computed
      property defined in this way might look like this:

      ```js
      let Person = Ember.Object.extend({
        init() {
          this._super(...arguments);

          this.firstName = 'Betty';
          this.lastName = 'Jones';
        },

        fullName: Ember.computed('firstName', 'lastName', function() {
          return `${this.get('firstName')} ${this.get('lastName')}`;
        })
      });

      let client = Person.create();

      client.get('fullName'); // 'Betty Jones'

      client.set('lastName', 'Fuller');
      client.get('fullName'); // 'Betty Fuller'
      ```

      You can pass a hash with two functions, `get` and `set`, as an
      argument to provide both a getter and setter:

      ```js
      let Person = Ember.Object.extend({
        init() {
          this._super(...arguments);

          this.firstName = 'Betty';
          this.lastName = 'Jones';
        },

        fullName: Ember.computed('firstName', 'lastName', {
          get(key) {
            return `${this.get('firstName')} ${this.get('lastName')}`;
          },
          set(key, value) {
            let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(/\s+/);
            this.setProperties({ firstName, lastName });
            return value;
          }
        });
      })

      let client = Person.create();
      client.get('firstName'); // 'Betty'

      client.set('fullName', 'Carroll Fuller');
      client.get('firstName'); // 'Carroll'
      ```

      The `set` function should accept two parameters, `key` and `value`. The value
      returned from `set` will be the new value of the property.

      _Note: This is the preferred way to define computed properties when writing third-party
      libraries that depend on or use Ember, since there is no guarantee that the user
      will have [prototype Extensions](http://emberjs.com/guides/configuring-ember/disabling-prototype-extensions/) enabled._

      The alternative syntax, with prototype extensions, might look like:

      ```js
      fullName: function() {
        return this.get('firstName') + ' ' + this.get('lastName');
      }.property('firstName', 'lastName')
      ```

      The purpose of the Ember Instrumentation module is
      to provide efficient, general-purpose instrumentation
      for Ember.

      Subscribe to a listener by using `Ember.subscribe`:

      ```javascript
      Ember.subscribe("render", {
        before(name, timestamp, payload) {

        },

        after(name, timestamp, payload) {

        }
      });
      ```

      If you return a value from the `before` callback, that same
      value will be passed as a fourth parameter to the `after`
      callback.

      Instrument a block of code by using `Ember.instrument`:

      ```javascript
      Ember.instrument("render.handlebars", payload, function() {
        // rendering logic
      }, binding);
      ```

      Event names passed to `Ember.instrument` are namespaced
      by periods, from more general to more specific. Subscribers
      can listen for events by whatever level of granularity they
      are interested in.

      In the above example, the event is `render.handlebars`,
      and the subscriber listened for all events beginning with
      `render`. It would receive callbacks for events named
      `render`, `render.handlebars`, `render.container`, or
      even `render.handlebars.layout`.

      ```

      Note that Mixins are created with `Ember.Mixin.create`, not
      `Ember.Mixin.extend`.

      Note that mixins extend a constructor's prototype so arrays and object literals
      defined as properties will be shared amongst objects that implement the mixin.
      If you want to define a property in a mixin that is not shared, you can define
      it either as a computed property or have it be created on initialization of the object.

      ```javascript
      // filters array will be shared amongst any object implementing mixin
      const FilterableMixin = Ember.Mixin.create({
        filters: Ember.A()
      });

      // filters will be a separate array for every object implementing the mixin
      const FilterableMixin = Ember.Mixin.create({
        filters: Ember.computed(function() {
          return Ember.A();
        })
      });

      // filters will be created as a separate array during the object's initialization
      const Filterable = Ember.Mixin.create({
        init() {
          this._super(...arguments);
          this.set("filters", Ember.A());
        }
      });
      ```

      Ember.Location returns an instance of the correct implementation of
      the `location` API.

      ## Implementations

      You can pass an implementation name (`hash`, `history`, `none`) to force a
      particular implementation to be used in your application.

      ### HashLocation

      Using `HashLocation` results in URLs with a `#` (hash sign) separating the
      server side URL portion of the URL from the portion that is used by Ember.
      This relies upon the `hashchange` event existing in the browser.

      Example:

      ```javascript
      App.Router.map(function() {
        this.route('posts', function() {
          this.route('new');
        });
      });

      App.Router.reopen({
        location: 'hash'
      });
      ```

      This will result in a posts.new url of `/#/posts/new`.

      ### HistoryLocation

      Using `HistoryLocation` results in URLs that are indistinguishable from a
      standard URL. This relies upon the browser's `history` API.

      Example:

      ```javascript
      App.Router.map(function() {
        this.route('posts', function() {
          this.route('new');
        });
      });

      App.Router.reopen({
        location: 'history'
      });
      ```

      This will result in a posts.new url of `/posts/new`.

      Keep in mind that your server must serve the Ember app at all the routes you
      define.

      ### AutoLocation

      Using `AutoLocation`, the router will use the best Location class supported by
      the browser it is running in.

      Browsers that support the `history` API will use `HistoryLocation`, those that
      do not, but still support the `hashchange` event will use `HashLocation`, and
      in the rare case neither is supported will use `NoneLocation`.

      Example:

      ```javascript
      App.Router.map(function() {
        this.route('posts', function() {
          this.route('new');
        });
      });

      App.Router.reopen({
        location: 'auto'
      });
      ```

      This will result in a posts.new url of `/posts/new` for modern browsers that
      support the `history` api or `/#/posts/new` for older ones, like Internet
      Explorer 9 and below.

      When a user visits a link to your application, they will be automatically
      upgraded or downgraded to the appropriate `Location` class, with the URL
      transformed accordingly, if needed.

      Keep in mind that since some of your users will use `HistoryLocation`, your
      server must serve the Ember app at all the routes you define.

      ### NoneLocation

      Using `NoneLocation` causes Ember to not store the applications URL state
      in the actual URL. This is generally used for testing purposes, and is one
      of the changes made when calling `App.setupForTesting()`.

      ## Location API

      Each location implementation must provide the following methods:

      * implementation: returns the string name used to reference the implementation.
      * getURL: returns the current URL.
      * setURL(path): sets the current URL.
      * replaceURL(path): replace the current URL (optional).
      * onUpdateURL(callback): triggers the callback when the URL changes.
      * formatURL(url): formats `url` to be placed into `href` attribute.
      * detect() (optional): instructs the location to do any feature detection
          necessary. If the location needs to redirect to a different URL, it
          can cancel routing by setting the `cancelRouterSetup` property on itself
          to `false`.

      Calling setURL or replaceURL will not trigger onUpdateURL callbacks.

      ## Custom implementation

      Ember scans `app/locations/*` for extending the Location API.

      Example:

      ```javascript
      import Ember from 'ember';

      export default Ember.HistoryLocation.extend({
        implementation: 'history-url-logging',

        pushState: function (path) {
          console.log(path);
          this._super.apply(this, arguments);
        }
      });
      ```

      This mixin implements Observer-friendly Array-like behavior. It is not a
      concrete implementation, but it can be used up by other classes that want
      to appear like arrays.

      For example, ArrayProxy is a concrete classes that can
      be instantiated to implement array-like behavior. Both of these classes use
      the Array Mixin by way of the MutableArray mixin, which allows observable
      changes to be made to the underlying array.

      Unlike `Ember.Enumerable,` this mixin defines methods specifically for
      collections that provide index-ordered access to their contents. When you
      are designing code that needs to accept any kind of Array-like object, you
      should use these methods instead of Array primitives because these will
      properly notify observers of changes to the array.

      Although these methods are efficient, they do add a layer of indirection to
      your application so it is a good idea to use them only when you need the
      flexibility of using both true JavaScript arrays and "virtual" arrays such
      as controllers and collections.

      You can use the methods defined in this module to access and modify array
      contents in a KVO-friendly way. You can also be notified whenever the
      membership of an array changes by using `.observes('myArray.[]')`.

      To support `Ember.Array` in your own class, you must override two
      primitives to use it: `length()` and `objectAt()`.

      Note that the Ember.Array mixin also incorporates the `Ember.Enumerable`
      mixin. All `Ember.Array`-like objects are also enumerable.

      This mixin defines the common interface implemented by enumerable objects
      in Ember. Most of these methods follow the standard Array iteration
      API defined up to JavaScript 1.8 (excluding language-specific features that
      cannot be emulated in older versions of JavaScript).

      This mixin is applied automatically to the Array class on page load, so you
      can use any of these methods on simple arrays. If Array already implements
      one of these methods, the mixin will not override them.

      ## Writing Your Own Enumerable

      To make your own custom class enumerable, you need two items:

      1. You must have a length property. This property should change whenever
         the number of items in your enumerable object changes. If you use this
         with an `Ember.Object` subclass, you should be sure to change the length
         property using `set().`

      2. You must implement `nextObject().` See documentation.

      Once you have these two methods implemented, apply the `Ember.Enumerable` mixin
      to your class and you will be able to enumerate the contents of your object
      like any other collection.

      ## Using Ember Enumeration with Other Libraries

      Many other libraries provide some kind of iterator or enumeration like
      facility. This is often where the most common API conflicts occur.
      Ember's API is designed to be as friendly as possible with other
      libraries by implementing only methods that mostly correspond to the
      JavaScript 1.8 API.

    description: |-
      The `Ember.Freezable` mixin implements some basic methods for marking an
      object as frozen. Once an object is frozen it should be read only. No changes
      may be made the internal state of the object.

      ## Enforcement

      To fully support freezing in your subclass, you must include this mixin and
      override any method that might alter any property on the object to instead
      raise an exception. You can check the state of an object by checking the
      `isFrozen` property.

      Although future versions of JavaScript may support language-level freezing
      object objects, that is not the case today. Even if an object is freezable,
      it is still technically possible to modify the object, even though it could
      break other parts of your application that do not expect a frozen object to
      change. It is, therefore, very important that you always respect the
      `isFrozen` property on all freezable objects.

      ## Example Usage

      The example below shows a simple object that implement the `Ember.Freezable`
      protocol.

      ```javascript
      Contact = Ember.Object.extend(Ember.Freezable, {
        firstName: null,
        lastName: null,

        // swaps the names
        swapNames: function() {
          if (this.get('isFrozen')) throw Ember.FROZEN_ERROR;
          var tmp = this.get('firstName');
          this.set('firstName', this.get('lastName'));
          this.set('lastName', tmp);
          return this;
        }

      });

      c = Contact.create({ firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe" });
      c.swapNames();  // returns c
      c.freeze();
      c.swapNames();  // EXCEPTION
      ```

      ## Copying

      Usually the `Ember.Freezable` protocol is implemented in cooperation with the
      `Ember.Copyable` protocol, which defines a `frozenCopy()` method that will
      return a frozen object, if the object implements this method as well.
    since: Ember 0.9
    deprecated: true
    deprecationMessage: Use `Object.freeze` instead.

      This mixin defines the API for modifying array-like objects. These methods
      can be applied only to a collection that keeps its items in an ordered set.
      It builds upon the Array mixin and adds methods to modify the array.
      One concrete implementations of this class include ArrayProxy.

      It is important to use the methods in this class to modify arrays so that
      changes are observable. This allows the binding system in Ember to function
      correctly.


      Note that an Array can change even if it does not implement this mixin.
      For example, one might implement a SparseArray that cannot be directly
      modified, but if its underlying enumerable changes, it will change also.

      This mixin defines the API for modifying generic enumerables. These methods

      Note that an Enumerable can change even if it does not implement this mixin.
      For example, a MappedEnumerable cannot be directly modified but if its
      underlying enumerable changes, it will change also.

      ## Adding Objects

      To add an object to an enumerable, use the `addObject()` method. This
      method will only add the object to the enumerable if the object is not
      already present and is of a type supported by the enumerable.

      ```javascript
      set.addObject(contact);
      ```

      ## Removing Objects

      To remove an object from an enumerable, use the `removeObject()` method. This
      will only remove the object if it is present in the enumerable, otherwise
      this method has no effect.

      ```javascript
      set.removeObject(contact);
      ```

      ## Implementing In Your Own Code

      If you are implementing an object and want to support this API, just include
      this mixin in your class and implement the required methods. In your unit

      ## Overview

      This mixin provides properties and property observing functionality, core
      features of the Ember object model.

      Properties and observers allow one object to observe changes to a
      property on another object. This is one of the fundamental ways that
      models, controllers and views communicate with each other in an Ember
      application.

      Any object that has this mixin applied can be used in observer
      operations. That includes `Ember.Object` and most objects you will
      interact with as you write your Ember application.

      Note that you will not generally apply this mixin to classes yourself,
      but you will use the features provided by this module frequently, so it
      is important to understand how to use it.

      ## Using `get()` and `set()`

      Because of Ember's support for bindings and observers, you will always
      access properties using the get method, and set properties using the
      set method. This allows the observing objects to be notified and
      computed properties to be handled properly.

      More documentation about `get` and `set` are below.

      ## Observing Property Changes

      You typically observe property changes simply by using the `Ember.observer`
      function in classes that you write.

      For example:

      ```javascript
      Ember.Object.extend({
        valueObserver: Ember.observer('value', function(sender, key, value, rev) {
          // Executes whenever the "value" property changes
          // See the addObserver method for more information about the callback arguments
        })
      });
      ```

      Although this is the most common way to add an observer, this capability
      is actually built into the `Ember.Object` class on top of two methods
      defined in this mixin: `addObserver` and `removeObserver`. You can use
      these two methods to add and remove observers yourself if you need to
      do so at runtime.

      To add an observer for a property, call:

      ```javascript
      object.addObserver('propertyKey', targetObject, targetAction)
      ```

      This will call the `targetAction` method on the `targetObject` whenever
      the value of the `propertyKey` changes.

      Note that if `propertyKey` is a computed property, the observer will be
      called when any of the property dependencies are changed, even if the
      resulting value of the computed property is unchanged. This is necessary
      because computed properties are not computed until `get` is called.

      A low level mixin making ObjectProxy promise-aware.

      ```javascript
      let ObjectPromiseProxy = Ember.ObjectProxy.extend(Ember.PromiseProxyMixin);

      let proxy = ObjectPromiseProxy.create({
        promise: Ember.RSVP.cast($.getJSON('/some/remote/data.json'))
      });

      proxy.then(function(json){
         // the json
      }, function(reason) {
         // the reason why you have no json
      });
      ```

      the proxy has bindable attributes which
      track the promises life cycle

      ```javascript
      proxy.get('isPending')   //=> true
      proxy.get('isSettled')  //=> false
      proxy.get('isRejected')  //=> false
      proxy.get('isFulfilled') //=> false
      ```

      When the $.getJSON completes, and the promise is fulfilled
      with json, the life cycle attributes will update accordingly.
      Note that $.getJSON doesn't return an ECMA specified promise,
      it is useful to wrap this with an `RSVP.cast` so that it behaves
      as a spec compliant promise.

      ```javascript
      proxy.get('isPending')   //=> false
      proxy.get('isSettled')   //=> true
      proxy.get('isRejected')  //=> false
      proxy.get('isFulfilled') //=> true
      ```

      As the proxy is an ObjectProxy, and the json now its content,
      all the json properties will be available directly from the proxy.

      ```javascript
      // Assuming the following json:
      {
        firstName: 'Stefan',
        lastName: 'Penner'
      }

      // both properties will accessible on the proxy
      proxy.get('firstName') //=> 'Stefan'
      proxy.get('lastName')  //=> 'Penner'

      An ArrayProxy wraps any other object that implements `Ember.Array` and/or
      `Ember.MutableArray,` forwarding all requests. This makes it very useful for
      a number of binding use cases or other cases where being able to swap
      out the underlying array is useful.

      A simple example of usage:

      ```javascript
      let pets = ['dog', 'cat', 'fish'];
      let ap = Ember.ArrayProxy.create({ content: Ember.A(pets) });

      ap.get('firstObject');                        // 'dog'
      ap.set('content', ['amoeba', 'paramecium']);
      ap.get('firstObject');                        // 'amoeba'
      ```

      This class can also be useful as a layer to transform the contents of
      an array, as they are accessed. This can be done by overriding
      `objectAtContent`:

      ```javascript
      let pets = ['dog', 'cat', 'fish'];
      let ap = Ember.ArrayProxy.create({
          content: Ember.A(pets),
          objectAtContent: function(idx) {
              return this.get('content').objectAt(idx).toUpperCase();
          }
      });

      ap.get('firstObject'); // . 'DOG'

      object.get('description')  // 'Foo is a whizboo baz'
      ```

      While `content` is unset, setting a property to be delegated will throw an
      Error.

      ```javascript
      proxy = Ember.ObjectProxy.create({
        content: null,

      `TextSupport` is a shared mixin used by both `Ember.TextField` and
      `Ember.TextArea`. `TextSupport` adds a number of methods that allow you to
      specify a controller action to invoke when a certain event is fired on your
      text field or textarea. The specifed controller action would get the current
      value of the field passed in as the only argument unless the value of
      the field is empty. In that case, the instance of the field itself is passed
      in as the only argument.

      Let's use the pressing of the escape key as an example. If you wanted to
      invoke a controller action when a user presses the escape key while on your
      field, you would use the `escape-press` attribute on your field like so:

      ```handlebars
        {{! application.hbs}}

        {{input escape-press='alertUser'}}
      ```

      ```javascript
          App = Ember.Application.create();

          App.ApplicationController = Ember.Controller.extend({
            actions: {
              alertUser: function ( currentValue ) {
                alert( 'escape pressed, current value: ' + currentValue );
              }
            }
          });
      ```

      The following chart is a visual representation of what takes place when the
      escape key is pressed in this scenario:

      ```

      |  actions: {                               |
      |     alertUser: function( currentValue ){  |
      |       alert( 'the esc key was pressed!' ) |
      |     }                                     |
      |  }                                        |
      |                                           |
      +-------------------------------------------+
      ```

      Here are the events that we currently support along with the name of the
      attribute you would need to use on your field. To reiterate, you would use the
      attribute name like so:

      ```handlebars
        {{input attribute-name='controllerAction'}}
      ```

      ```

      `Ember.View` is the class in Ember responsible for encapsulating templates of
      HTML content, combining templates with data to render as sections of a page's
      DOM, and registering and responding to user-initiated events.

      ## HTML Tag

      The default HTML tag name used for a view's DOM representation is `div`. This
      can be customized by setting the `tagName` property. The following view
      class:

      ```javascript
      ParagraphView = Ember.View.extend({
        tagName: 'em'
      });
      ```

      Would result in instances with the following HTML:

      ```html
      <em id="ember1" class="ember-view"></em>
      ```

      ## HTML `class` Attribute

      The HTML `class` attribute of a view's tag can be set by providing a
      `classNames` property that is set to an array of strings:

      ```javascript
      MyView = Ember.View.extend({
        classNames: ['my-class', 'my-other-class']
      });
      ```

      Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:

      ```html
      <div id="ember1" class="ember-view my-class my-other-class"></div>
      ```

      `class` attribute values can also be set by providing a `classNameBindings`
      property set to an array of properties names for the view. The return value
      of these properties will be added as part of the value for the view's `class`
      attribute. These properties can be computed properties:

      ```javascript
      MyView = Ember.View.extend({
        classNameBindings: ['propertyA', 'propertyB'],
        propertyA: 'from-a',
        propertyB: Ember.computed(function() {
          if (someLogic) { return 'from-b'; }
        })
      });
      ```

      Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:

      ```html
      <div id="ember1" class="ember-view from-a from-b"></div>
      ```

      If the value of a class name binding returns a boolean the property name
      itself will be used as the class name if the property is true. The class name
      will not be added if the value is `false` or `undefined`.

      ```javascript
      MyView = Ember.View.extend({
        classNameBindings: ['hovered'],
        hovered: true
      });
      ```

      Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:

      ```html
      <div id="ember1" class="ember-view hovered"></div>
      ```

      When using boolean class name bindings you can supply a string value other
      than the property name for use as the `class` HTML attribute by appending the
      preferred value after a ":" character when defining the binding:

      ```javascript
      MyView = Ember.View.extend({
        classNameBindings: ['awesome:so-very-cool'],
        awesome: true
      });
      ```

      Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:

      ```html
      <div id="ember1" class="ember-view so-very-cool"></div>
      ```

      Boolean value class name bindings whose property names are in a
      camelCase-style format will be converted to a dasherized format:

      ```javascript
      MyView = Ember.View.extend({
        classNameBindings: ['isUrgent'],
        isUrgent: true
      });
      ```

      Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:

      ```html
      <div id="ember1" class="ember-view is-urgent"></div>
      ```

      Class name bindings can also refer to object values that are found by
      traversing a path relative to the view itself:

      ```javascript
      MyView = Ember.View.extend({
        classNameBindings: ['messages.empty']
        messages: Ember.Object.create({
          empty: true
        })
      });
      ```

      Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:

      ```html
      <div id="ember1" class="ember-view empty"></div>
      ```

      If you want to add a class name for a property which evaluates to true and
      and a different class name if it evaluates to false, you can pass a binding
      like this:

      ```javascript
      // Applies 'enabled' class when isEnabled is true and 'disabled' when isEnabled is false
      Ember.View.extend({
        classNameBindings: ['isEnabled:enabled:disabled']
        isEnabled: true
      });
      ```

      Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:

      ```html
      <div id="ember1" class="ember-view enabled"></div>
      ```

      When isEnabled is `false`, the resulting HTML representation looks like
      this:

      ```html
      <div id="ember1" class="ember-view disabled"></div>
      ```

      This syntax offers the convenience to add a class if a property is `false`:

      ```javascript
      // Applies no class when isEnabled is true and class 'disabled' when isEnabled is false
      Ember.View.extend({
        classNameBindings: ['isEnabled::disabled']
        isEnabled: true
      });
      ```

      Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:

      ```html
      <div id="ember1" class="ember-view"></div>
      ```

      When the `isEnabled` property on the view is set to `false`, it will result
      in view instances with an HTML representation of:

      ```html
      <div id="ember1" class="ember-view disabled"></div>
      ```

      Updates to the value of a class name binding will result in automatic
      update of the  HTML `class` attribute in the view's rendered HTML
      representation. If the value becomes `false` or `undefined` the class name
      will be removed.

      Both `classNames` and `classNameBindings` are concatenated properties. See
      [Ember.Object](/api/classes/Ember.Object.html) documentation for more
      information about concatenated properties.

      ## HTML Attributes

      The HTML attribute section of a view's tag can be set by providing an
      `attributeBindings` property set to an array of property names on the view.
      The return value of these properties will be used as the value of the view's
      HTML associated attribute:

      ```javascript
      AnchorView = Ember.View.extend({
        tagName: 'a',
        attributeBindings: ['href'],
        href: 'http://google.com'
      });
      ```

      Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:

      ```html
      <a id="ember1" class="ember-view" href="http://google.com"></a>
      ```

      One property can be mapped on to another by placing a ":" between
      the source property and the destination property:

      ```javascript
      AnchorView = Ember.View.extend({
        tagName: 'a',
        attributeBindings: ['url:href'],
        url: 'http://google.com'
      });
      ```

      Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:

      ```html
      <a id="ember1" class="ember-view" href="http://google.com"></a>
      ```

      Namespaced attributes (e.g. `xlink:href`) are supported, but have to be
      mapped, since `:` is not a valid character for properties in Javascript:

      ```javascript
      UseView = Ember.View.extend({
        tagName: 'use',
        attributeBindings: ['xlinkHref:xlink:href'],
        xlinkHref: '#triangle'
      });
      ```
      Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:

      ```html
      <use xlink:href="#triangle"></use>
      ```

      If the return value of an `attributeBindings` monitored property is a boolean
      the attribute will be present or absent depending on the value:

      ```javascript
      MyTextInput = Ember.View.extend({
        tagName: 'input',
        attributeBindings: ['disabled'],
        disabled: false
      });
      ```

      Will result in a view instance with an HTML representation of:

      ```html
      <input id="ember1" class="ember-view" />
      ```

      `attributeBindings` can refer to computed properties:

      ```javascript
      MyTextInput = Ember.View.extend({
        tagName: 'input',
        attributeBindings: ['disabled'],
        disabled: Ember.computed(function() {
          if (someLogic) {
            return true;
          } else {
            return false;
          }
        })
      });
      ```

      To prevent setting an attribute altogether, use `null` or `undefined` as the
      return value of the `attributeBindings` monitored property:

      ```javascript
      MyTextInput = Ember.View.extend({
        tagName: 'form',
        attributeBindings: ['novalidate'],
        novalidate: null
      });
      ```

      Updates to the property of an attribute binding will result in automatic
      update of the  HTML attribute in the view's rendered HTML representation.

      `attributeBindings` is a concatenated property. See [Ember.Object](/api/classes/Ember.Object.html)
      documentation for more information about concatenated properties.

      ## Layouts

      Views can have a secondary template that wraps their main template. Like
      primary templates, layouts can be any function that  accepts an optional
      context parameter and returns a string of HTML that will be inserted inside
      view's tag. Views whose HTML element is self closing (e.g. `<input />`)
      cannot have a layout and this property will be ignored.

      Most typically in Ember a layout will be a compiled template.

      A view's layout can be set directly with the `layout` property or reference
      an existing template by name with the `layoutName` property.

      A template used as a layout must contain a single use of the
      `{{yield}}` helper. The HTML contents of a view's rendered `template` will be
      inserted at this location:

      ```javascript
      AViewWithLayout = Ember.View.extend({
        layout: Ember.HTMLBars.compile("<div class='my-decorative-class'>{{yield}}</div>"),
        template: Ember.HTMLBars.compile("I got wrapped")
      });
      ```

      Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:

      ```html
      <div id="ember1" class="ember-view">
        <div class="my-decorative-class">
          I got wrapped
        </div>
      </div>
      ```

      See [Ember.Templates.helpers.yield](/api/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers.html#method_yield)
      for more information.

      ## Responding to Browser Events

      Views can respond to user-initiated events in one of three ways: method
      implementation, through an event manager, and through `{{action}}` helper use
      in their template or layout.

      ### Method Implementation

      Views can respond to user-initiated events by implementing a method that
      matches the event name. A `jQuery.Event` object will be passed as the
      argument to this method.

      ```javascript
      AView = Ember.View.extend({
        click: function(event) {
          // will be called when an instance's
          // rendered element is clicked
        }
      });
      ```

      ### Event Managers

      Views can define an object as their `eventManager` property. This object can
      then implement methods that match the desired event names. Matching events
      that occur on the view's rendered HTML or the rendered HTML of any of its DOM
      descendants will trigger this method. A `jQuery.Event` object will be passed
      as the first argument to the method and an  `Ember.View` object as the
      second. The `Ember.View` will be the view whose rendered HTML was interacted
      with. This may be the view with the `eventManager` property or one of its
      descendant views.

      ```javascript
      AView = Ember.View.extend({
        eventManager: Ember.Object.create({
          doubleClick: function(event, view) {
            // will be called when an instance's
            // rendered element or any rendering
            // of this view's descendant
            // elements is clicked
          }
        })
      });
      ```

      An event defined for an event manager takes precedence over events of the
      same name handled through methods on the view.

      ```javascript
      AView = Ember.View.extend({
        mouseEnter: function(event) {
          // will never trigger.
        },
        eventManager: Ember.Object.create({
          mouseEnter: function(event, view) {
            // takes precedence over AView#mouseEnter
          }
        })
      });
      ```

      Similarly a view's event manager will take precedence for events of any views
      rendered as a descendant. A method name that matches an event name will not
      be called if the view instance was rendered inside the HTML representation of
      a view that has an `eventManager` property defined that handles events of the
      name. Events not handled by the event manager will still trigger method calls
      on the descendant.

      ```javascript
      var App = Ember.Application.create();
      App.OuterView = Ember.View.extend({
        template: Ember.HTMLBars.compile("outer {{#view 'inner'}}inner{{/view}} outer"),
        eventManager: Ember.Object.create({
          mouseEnter: function(event, view) {
            // view might be instance of either
            // OuterView or InnerView depending on
            // where on the page the user interaction occurred
          }
        })
      });

      App.InnerView = Ember.View.extend({
        click: function(event) {
          // will be called if rendered inside
          // an OuterView because OuterView's

      See [Ember.Templates.helpers.action](/api/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers.html#method_action).

      ### Event Names

      All of the event handling approaches described above respond to the same set
      of events. The names of the built-in events are listed below. (The hash of
      built-in events exists in `Ember.EventDispatcher`.) Additional, custom events
      can be registered by using `Ember.Application.customEvents`.

      Touch events:

      * `touchStart`
      * `touchMove`
      * `touchEnd`
      * `touchCancel`

      Keyboard events

      * `keyDown`
      * `keyUp`
      * `keyPress`

      Mouse events

      * `mouseDown`
      * `mouseUp`
      * `contextMenu`
      * `click`
      * `doubleClick`
      * `mouseMove`
      * `focusIn`
      * `focusOut`
      * `mouseEnter`
      * `mouseLeave`

      Form events:

      * `submit`
      * `change`
      * `focusIn`
      * `focusOut`
      * `input`

      HTML5 drag and drop events:

      * `dragStart`
      * `drag`
      * `dragEnter`
      * `dragLeave`
      * `dragOver`
      * `dragEnd`
      * `drop`

    Given a fullName return a corresponding instance.

    The default behaviour is for lookup to return a singleton instance.
    The singleton is scoped to the container, allowing multiple containers
    to all have their own locally scoped singletons.

    ```javascript
    let registry = new Registry();
    let container = registry.container();

    registry.register('api:twitter', Twitter);

    let twitter = container.lookup('api:twitter');

    twitter instanceof Twitter; // => true

    // by default the container will return singletons
    let twitter2 = container.lookup('api:twitter');
    twitter2 instanceof Twitter; // => true

    twitter === twitter2; //=> true
    ```

    If singletons are not wanted, an optional flag can be provided at lookup.

    ```javascript
    let registry = new Registry();
    let container = registry.container();

    registry.register('api:twitter', Twitter);

    let twitter = container.lookup('api:twitter', { singleton: false });
    let twitter2 = container.lookup('api:twitter', { singleton: false });

    twitter === twitter2; //=> false
    ```

    The DOM events for which the event dispatcher should listen.

    By default, the application's `Ember.EventDispatcher` listens
    for a set of standard DOM events, such as `mousedown` and
    `keyup`, and delegates them to your application's `Ember.View`
    instances.

    If you would like additional bubbling events to be delegated to your
    views, set your `Ember.Application`'s `customEvents` property
    to a hash containing the DOM event name as the key and the
    corresponding view method name as the value. Setting an event to
    a value of `null` will prevent a default event listener from being
    added for that event.

    To add new events to be listened to:

    ```javascript
    let App = Ember.Application.create({
      customEvents: {
        // add support for the paste event
        paste: 'paste'
      }
    });
    ```

    To prevent default events from being listened to:

    ```javascript
    let App = Ember.Application.create({
      customEvents: {
        // remove support for mouseenter / mouseleave events
        mouseenter: null,
        mouseleave: null

    Whether the application should be configured for the legacy "globals mode".
    Under this mode, the Application object serves as a global namespace for all
    classes.

    ```javascript
    let App = Ember.Application.create({
      ...
    });

    App.Router.reopen({
      location: 'none'
    });

    App.Router.map({
      ...
    });

    App.MyComponent = Ember.Component.extend({
      ...
    });
    ```

    This flag also exposes other internal APIs that assumes the existence of
    a special "default instance", like `App.__container__.lookup(...)`.

    This option is currently not configurable, its value is derived from
    the `autoboot` flag – disabling `autoboot` also implies opting-out of
    globals mode support, although they are ultimately orthogonal concerns.

    Some of the global modes features are already deprecated in 1.x. The
    existence of this flag is to untangle the globals mode code paths from
    the autoboot code paths, so that these legacy features can be reviewed
    for deprecation/removal separately.

    Forcing the (autoboot=true, _globalsMode=false) here and running the tests
    would reveal all the places where we are still relying on these legacy
    behavior internally (mostly just tests).

    Automatically kick-off the boot process for the application once the

    The initialization itself is scheduled on the actions queue which

    has finished loading.

    This is the autoboot flow:

    1. Boot the app by calling `this.boot()`
    2. Create an instance (or use the `__deprecatedInstance__` in globals mode)
    3. Boot the instance by calling `instance.boot()`
    4. Invoke the `App.ready()` callback
    5. Kick-off routing on the instance

    Ideally, this is all we would need to do:

    ```javascript
    _autoBoot() {
      this.boot().then(() => {
        let instance = (this._globalsMode) ? this.__deprecatedInstance__ : this.buildInstance();
        return instance.boot();
      }).then((instance) => {
        App.ready();
        instance.startRouting();
      });
    }
    ```

    Unfortunately, we cannot actually write this because we need to participate
    in the "synchronous" boot process. While the code above would work fine on
    the initial boot (i.e. DOM ready), when `App.reset()` is called, we need to
    boot a new instance synchronously (see the documentation on `_bootSync()`
    for details).

    Because of this restriction, the actual logic of this method is located
    inside `didBecomeReady()`.

    Use this to defer readiness until some condition is true.

    Example:

    ```javascript

    Ember.$.getJSON('/auth-token', function(token) {
      App.token = token;
      App.advanceReadiness();
    });
    ```

    This allows you to perform asynchronous setup logic and defer
    booting your application until the setup has finished.

    However, if the setup requires a loading UI, it might be better
    to use the router for this purpose.

    Unfortunately, a lot of existing code assumes the booting process is
    "synchronous". Specifically, a lot of tests assumes the last call to
    `app.advanceReadiness()` or `app.reset()` will result in the app being
    fully-booted when the current runloop completes.

    We would like new code (like the `visit` API) to stop making this assumption,
    so we created the asynchronous version above that returns a promise. But until
    we have migrated all the code, we would have to expose this method for use
    *internally* in places where we need to boot an app "synchronously".

    Reset the application. This is typically used only in tests. It cleans up
    the application in the following order:

    1. Deactivate existing routes
    2. Destroy all objects in the container
    3. Create a new application container
    4. Re-route to the existing url

    Typical Example:

    ```javascript
    let App;

    run(function() {
      App = Ember.Application.create();
    });

    module('acceptance test', {
      setup: function() {

      }

    test('first test', function() {
      // App is freshly reset
    });

    test('second test', function() {
      // App is again freshly reset
    });
    ```

    Advanced Example:

    Occasionally you may want to prevent the app from initializing during

      run(function() {

    Boot a new instance of `Ember.ApplicationInstance` for the current
    application and navigate it to the given `url`. Returns a `Promise` that
    resolves with the instance when the initial routing and rendering is
    complete, or rejects with any error that occured during the boot process.

    When `autoboot` is disabled, calling `visit` would first cause the
    application to boot, which runs the application initializers.

    This method also takes a hash of boot-time configuration options for
    customizing the instance's behavior. See the documentation on
    `Ember.ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` for details.

    `Ember.ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` is an interface class that exists
    purely to document the available options; you do not need to construct it
    manually. Simply pass a regular JavaScript object containing of the
    desired options:

    ```javascript
    MyApp.visit("/", { location: "none", rootElement: "#container" });
    ```

    ### Supported Scenarios

    While the `BootOptions` class exposes a large number of knobs, not all
    combinations of them are valid; certain incompatible combinations might
    result in unexpected behavior.

    For example, booting the instance in the full browser environment
    while specifying a foriegn `document` object (e.g. `{ isBrowser: true,
    document: iframe.contentDocument }`) does not work correctly today,
    largely due to Ember's jQuery dependency.

    Currently, there are three officially supported scenarios/configurations.
    Usages outside of these scenarios are not guaranteed to work, but please
    feel free to file bug reports documenting your experience and any issues
    you encountered to help expand support.

    #### Browser Applications (Manual Boot)

    The setup is largely similar to how Ember works out-of-the-box. Normally,
    Ember will boot a default instance for your Application on "DOM ready".
    However, you can customize this behavior by disabling `autoboot`.

    For example, this allows you to render a miniture demo of your application
    into a specific area on your marketing website:

    ```javascript
    import MyApp from 'my-app';

    $(function() {
      let App = MyApp.create({ autoboot: false });

      let options = {
        // Override the router's location adapter to prevent it from updating
        // the URL in the address bar
        location: 'none',

        // Override the default `rootElement` on the app to render into a
        // specific `div` on the page
        rootElement: '#demo'
      };

      // Start the app at the special demo URL
      App.visit('/demo', options);
    });
    ````

    Or perhaps you might want to boot two instances of your app on the same
    page for a split-screen multiplayer experience:

    ```javascript
    import MyApp from 'my-app';

    $(function() {
      let App = MyApp.create({ autoboot: false });

      let sessionId = MyApp.generateSessionID();

      let player1 = App.visit(`/matches/join?name=Player+1&session=${sessionId}`, { rootElement: '#left', location: 'none' });
      let player2 = App.visit(`/matches/join?name=Player+2&session=${sessionId}`, { rootElement: '#right', location: 'none' });

      Promise.all([player1, player2]).then(() => {
        // Both apps have completed the initial render
        $('#loading').fadeOut();
      });
    });
    ```

    Do note that each app instance maintains their own registry/container, so
    they will run in complete isolation by default.

    #### Server-Side Rendering (also known as FastBoot)

    This setup allows you to run your Ember app in a server environment using
    Node.js and render its content into static HTML for SEO purposes.

    ```javascript
    const HTMLSerializer = new SimpleDOM.HTMLSerializer(SimpleDOM.voidMap);

    function renderURL(url) {
      let dom = new SimpleDOM.Document();
      let rootElement = dom.body;
      let options = { isBrowser: false, document: dom, rootElement: rootElement };

      return MyApp.visit(options).then(instance => {
        try {
          return HTMLSerializer.serialize(rootElement.firstChild);
        } finally {
          instance.destroy();
        }
      });
    }
    ```

    In this scenario, because Ember does not have access to a global `document`
    object in the Node.js environment, you must provide one explicitly. In practice,
    in the non-browser environment, the stand-in `document` object only need to
    implement a limited subset of the full DOM API. The `SimpleDOM` library is known
    to work.

    Since there is no access to jQuery in the non-browser environment, you must also
    specify a DOM `Element` object in the same `document` for the `rootElement` option
    (as opposed to a selector string like `"body"`).

    See the documentation on the `isBrowser`, `document` and `rootElement` properties
    on `Ember.ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` for details.

    #### Server-Side Resource Discovery

    This setup allows you to run the routing layer of your Ember app in a server
    environment using Node.js and completely disable rendering. This allows you
    to simulate and discover the resources (i.e. AJAX requests) needed to fufill
    a given request and eagerly "push" these resources to the client.

    ```app/initializers/network-service.js
    import BrowserNetworkService from 'app/services/network/browser';
    import NodeNetworkService from 'app/services/network/node';

    // Inject a (hypothetical) service for abstracting all AJAX calls and use
    // the appropiate implementaion on the client/server. This also allows the
    // server to log all the AJAX calls made during a particular request and use
    // that for resource-discovery purpose.

    export function initialize(application) {
      if (window) { // browser
        application.register('service:network', BrowserNetworkService);
      } else { // node
        application.register('service:network', NodeNetworkService);
      }

      application.inject('route', 'network', 'service:network');
    };

    export default {
      name: 'network-service',
      initialize: initialize
    };
    ```

    ```app/routes/post.js
    import Ember from 'ember';

    // An example of how the (hypothetical) service is used in routes.

    export default Ember.Route.extend({
      model(params) {
        return this.network.fetch(`/api/posts/${params.post_id}.json`);
      },

      afterModel(post) {
        if (post.isExternalContent) {
          return this.network.fetch(`/api/external/?url=${post.externalURL}`);
        } else {
          return post;
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    ```javascript
    // Finally, put all the pieces together

    function discoverResourcesFor(url) {
      return MyApp.visit(url, { isBrowser: false, shouldRender: false }).then(instance => {
        let networkService = instance.lookup('service:network');
        return networkService.requests; // => { "/api/posts/123.json": "..." }
      });
    }
    ```

    Unfortunately, a lot of existing code assumes booting an instance is
    synchronous – specifically, a lot of tests assume the last call to
    `app.advanceReadiness()` or `app.reset()` will result in a new instance
    being fully-booted when the current runloop completes.

    We would like new code (like the `visit` API) to stop making this
    assumption, so we created the asynchronous version above that returns a
    promise. But until we have migrated all the code, we would have to expose
    this method for use *internally* in places where we need to boot an instance
    synchronously.

    The goal of initializers should be to register dependencies and injections.
    This phase runs once. Because these initializers may load code, they are
    allowed to defer application readiness and advance it. If you need to access
    the container or store you should use an InstanceInitializer that will be run
    after all initializers and therefore after all code is loaded and the app is
    ready.

    Initializer receives an object which has the following attributes:
    `name`, `before`, `after`, `initialize`. The only required attribute is
    `initialize`, all others are optional.

    * `name` allows you to specify under which name the initializer is registered.
    This must be a unique name, as trying to register two initializers with the
    same name will result in an error.

    ```javascript
    Ember.Application.initializer({
      name: 'namedInitializer',

      initialize: function(application) {
        Ember.debug('Running namedInitializer!');
      }
    });
    ```

    * `before` and `after` are used to ensure that this initializer is ran prior
    or after the one identified by the value. This value can be a single string
    or an array of strings, referencing the `name` of other initializers.

    An example of ordering initializers, we create an initializer named `first`:

    ```javascript
    Ember.Application.initializer({
      name: 'first',

      initialize: function(application) {
        Ember.debug('First initializer!');
      }
    });

    // DEBUG: First initializer!
    ```

    We add another initializer named `second`, specifying that it should run
    after the initializer named `first`:

    ```javascript
    Ember.Application.initializer({
      name: 'second',
      after: 'first',

      initialize: function(application) {
        Ember.debug('Second initializer!');
      }
    });

    // DEBUG: First initializer!
    // DEBUG: Second initializer!
    ```

    Afterwards we add a further initializer named `pre`, this time specifying
    that it should run before the initializer named `first`:

    ```javascript
    Ember.Application.initializer({
      name: 'pre',
      before: 'first',

      initialize: function(application) {
        Ember.debug('Pre initializer!');
      }
    });

    // DEBUG: Pre initializer!
    // DEBUG: First initializer!
    // DEBUG: Second initializer!
    ```

    Finally we add an initializer named `post`, specifying it should run after
    both the `first` and the `second` initializers:

    ```javascript
    Ember.Application.initializer({
      name: 'post',
      after: ['first', 'second'],

      initialize: function(application) {
        Ember.debug('Post initializer!');
      }
    });

    // DEBUG: Pre initializer!
    // DEBUG: First initializer!
    // DEBUG: Second initializer!
    // DEBUG: Post initializer!
    ```

    * `initialize` is a callback function that receives one argument,
      `application`, on which you can operate.

    Example of using `application` to register an adapter:

    ```javascript
    Ember.Application.initializer({
      name: 'api-adapter',

      initialize: function(application) {
        application.register('api-adapter:main', ApiAdapter);
      }
    });
    ```

    Instance initializers run after all initializers have run. Because
    instance initializers run after the app is fully set up. We have access
    to the store, container, and other items. However, these initializers run
    after code has loaded and are not allowed to defer readiness.

    Instance initializer receives an object which has the following attributes:
    `name`, `before`, `after`, `initialize`. The only required attribute is
    `initialize`, all others are optional.

    * `name` allows you to specify under which name the instanceInitializer is
    registered. This must be a unique name, as trying to register two
    instanceInitializer with the same name will result in an error.

    ```javascript
    Ember.Application.instanceInitializer({
      name: 'namedinstanceInitializer',

      initialize: function(application) {
        Ember.debug('Running namedInitializer!');
      }
    });
    ```

    * `before` and `after` are used to ensure that this initializer is ran prior
    or after the one identified by the value. This value can be a single string
    or an array of strings, referencing the `name` of other initializers.

    * See Ember.Application.initializer for discussion on the usage of before
    and after.

    Example instanceInitializer to preload data into the store.

    ```javascript
    Ember.Application.initializer({
      name: 'preload-data',

      initialize: function(application) {
        var userConfig, userConfigEncoded, store;
        // We have a HTML escaped JSON representation of the user's basic
        // configuration generated server side and stored in the DOM of the main
        // index.html file. This allows the app to have access to a set of data
        // without making any additional remote calls. Good for basic data that is
        // needed for immediate rendering of the page. Keep in mind, this data,
        // like all local models and data can be manipulated by the user, so it
        // should not be relied upon for security or authorization.
        //
        // Grab the encoded data from the meta tag
        userConfigEncoded = Ember.$('head meta[name=app-user-config]').attr('content');
        // Unescape the text, then parse the resulting JSON into a real object
        userConfig = JSON.parse(unescape(userConfigEncoded));
        // Lookup the store
        store = application.lookup('service:store');
        // Push the encoded JSON into the store
        store.pushPayload(userConfig);
      }
    });

    Allows for runtime registration of handler functions that override the default deprecation behavior.
    Deprecations are invoked by calls to [Ember.deprecate](http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.html#method_deprecate).
    The following example demonstrates its usage by registering a handler that throws an error if the
    message contains the word "should", otherwise defers to the default handler.

    ```javascript
    Ember.Debug.registerDeprecationHandler((message, options, next) => {
      if (message.indexOf('should') !== -1) {
        throw new Error(`Deprecation message with should: ${message}`);
      } else {
        // defer to whatever handler was registered before this one
        next(message, options);
      }
    });
    ```

    The handler function takes the following arguments:

    <ul>
      <li> <code>message</code> - The message received from the deprecation call.</li>
      <li> <code>options</code> - An object passed in with the deprecation call containing additional information including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li> <code>id</code> - An id of the deprecation in the form of <code>package-name.specific-deprecation</code>.</li>
          <li> <code>until</code> - The Ember version number the feature and deprecation will be removed in.</li>

    The `{{link-to}}` component renders a link to the supplied
    `routeName` passing an optionally supplied model to the
    route as its `model` context of the route. The block
    for `{{link-to}}` becomes the innerHTML of the rendered
    element:

    ```handlebars
    {{#link-to 'photoGallery'}}
      Great Hamster Photos
    {{/link-to}}
    ```

    You can also use an inline form of `{{link-to}}` component by
    passing the link text as the first argument
    to the component:

    ```handlebars
    {{link-to 'Great Hamster Photos' 'photoGallery'}}
    ```

    Both will result in:

    ```html
    <a href="/hamster-photos">
      Great Hamster Photos
    </a>
    ```

    ### Supplying a tagName
    By default `{{link-to}}` renders an `<a>` element. This can
    be overridden for a single use of `{{link-to}}` by supplying
    a `tagName` option:

    ```handlebars
    {{#link-to 'photoGallery' tagName="li"}}
      Great Hamster Photos
    {{/link-to}}
    ```

    ```html
    <li>
      Great Hamster Photos
    </li>
    ```

    To override this option for your entire application, see
    "Overriding Application-wide Defaults".

    ### Disabling the `link-to` component
    By default `{{link-to}}` is enabled.
    any passed value to the `disabled` component property will disable
    the `link-to` component.

    static use: the `disabled` option:

    ```handlebars
    {{#link-to 'photoGallery' disabled=true}}
      Great Hamster Photos
    {{/link-to}}
    ```

    dynamic use: the `disabledWhen` option:

    ```handlebars
    {{#link-to 'photoGallery' disabledWhen=controller.someProperty}}
      Great Hamster Photos
    {{/link-to}}
    ```

    any passed value to `disabled` will disable it except `undefined`.
    to ensure that only `true` disable the `link-to` component you can
    override the global behaviour of `Ember.LinkComponent`.

    ```javascript
    Ember.LinkComponent.reopen({
      disabled: Ember.computed(function(key, value) {
        if (value !== undefined) {
          this.set('_isDisabled', value === true);
        }
        return value === true ? get(this, 'disabledClass') : false;
      })
    });
    ```

    see "Overriding Application-wide Defaults" for more.

    ### Handling `href`
    `{{link-to}}` will use your application's Router to
    fill the element's `href` property with a url that
    matches the path to the supplied `routeName` for your
    router's configured `Location` scheme, which defaults
    to Ember.HashLocation.

    ### Handling current route
    `{{link-to}}` will apply a CSS class name of 'active'
    when the application's current route matches
    the supplied routeName. For example, if the application's
    current route is 'photoGallery.recent' the following
    use of `{{link-to}}`:

    ```handlebars
    {{#link-to 'photoGallery.recent'}}
      Great Hamster Photos
    {{/link-to}}
    ```

    will result in

    ```html
    <a href="/hamster-photos/this-week" class="active">
      Great Hamster Photos
    </a>
    ```

    The CSS class name used for active classes can be customized
    for a single use of `{{link-to}}` by passing an `activeClass`
    option:

    ```handlebars
    {{#link-to 'photoGallery.recent' activeClass="current-url"}}
      Great Hamster Photos
    {{/link-to}}
    ```

    ```html
    <a href="/hamster-photos/this-week" class="current-url">
      Great Hamster Photos
    </a>
    ```

    To override this option for your entire application, see
    "Overriding Application-wide Defaults".

    ### Keeping a link active for other routes

    If you need a link to be 'active' even when it doesn't match
    the current route, you can use the `current-when` argument.

    ```handlebars
    {{#link-to 'photoGallery' current-when='photos'}}
      Photo Gallery
    {{/link-to}}
    ```

    This may be helpful for keeping links active for:

    * non-nested routes that are logically related
    * some secondary menu approaches
    * 'top navigation' with 'sub navigation' scenarios

    A link will be active if `current-when` is `true` or the current
    route is the route this link would transition to.

    To match multiple routes 'space-separate' the routes:

    ```handlebars
    {{#link-to 'gallery' current-when='photos drawings paintings'}}
      Art Gallery
    {{/link-to}}
    ```

    ### Supplying a model
    An optional model argument can be used for routes whose
    paths contain dynamic segments. This argument will become
    the model context of the linked route:

    ```javascript
    Router.map(function() {
      this.route("photoGallery", {path: "hamster-photos/:photo_id"});
    });
    ```

    ```handlebars
    {{#link-to 'photoGallery' aPhoto}}
      {{aPhoto.title}}
    {{/link-to}}
    ```

    ```html
    <a href="/hamster-photos/42">
      Tomster
    </a>
    ```

    ### Supplying multiple models
    For deep-linking to route paths that contain multiple
    dynamic segments, multiple model arguments can be used.
    As the router transitions through the route path, each
    supplied model argument will become the context for the
    route with the dynamic segments:

    ```javascript
    Router.map(function() {
      this.route("photoGallery", { path: "hamster-photos/:photo_id" }, function() {
        this.route("comment", {path: "comments/:comment_id"});
      });
    });
    ```
    This argument will become the model context of the linked route:

    ```handlebars
    {{#link-to 'photoGallery.comment' aPhoto comment}}
      {{comment.body}}
    {{/link-to}}
    ```

    ```html
    <a href="/hamster-photos/42/comments/718">
      A+++ would snuggle again.
    </a>
    ```

    ### Supplying an explicit dynamic segment value
    If you don't have a model object available to pass to `{{link-to}}`,
    an optional string or integer argument can be passed for routes whose
    paths contain dynamic segments. This argument will become the value
    of the dynamic segment:

    ```javascript
    Router.map(function() {
      this.route("photoGallery", { path: "hamster-photos/:photo_id" });
    });
    ```

    ```handlebars
    {{#link-to 'photoGallery' aPhotoId}}
      {{aPhoto.title}}
    {{/link-to}}
    ```

    ```html
    <a href="/hamster-photos/42">
      Tomster
    </a>
    ```

    When transitioning into the linked route, the `model` hook will
    be triggered with parameters including this passed identifier.

    ### Allowing Default Action

     By default the `{{link-to}}` component prevents the default browser action
     by calling `preventDefault()` as this sort of action bubbling is normally
     handled internally and we do not want to take the browser to a new URL (for
     example).

     If you need to override this behavior specify `preventDefault=false` in
     your template:

    ```handlebars
    {{#link-to 'photoGallery' aPhotoId preventDefault=false}}
      {{aPhotoId.title}}
    {{/link-to}}
    ```

    ### Overriding attributes
    You can override any given property of the `Ember.LinkComponent`
    that is generated by the `{{link-to}}` component by passing
    key/value pairs, like so:

    ```handlebars
    {{#link-to  aPhoto tagName='li' title='Following this link will change your life' classNames='pic sweet'}}
      Uh-mazing!
    {{/link-to}}
    ```

    See [Ember.LinkComponent](/api/classes/Ember.LinkComponent.html) for a
    complete list of overrideable properties. Be sure to also
    check out inherited properties of `LinkComponent`.

    ### Overriding Application-wide Defaults
    ``{{link-to}}`` creates an instance of `Ember.LinkComponent`
    for rendering. To override options for your entire
    application, reopen `Ember.LinkComponent` and supply the
    desired values:

    ``` javascript
    Ember.LinkComponent.reopen({
      activeClass: "is-active",
      tagName: 'li'
    })
    ```

    It is also possible to override the default event in
    this manner:

    ``` javascript
    Ember.LinkComponent.reopen({
      eventName: 'customEventName'
    });
    ```

    `{{textarea}}` inserts a new instance of `<textarea>` tag into the template.
    The attributes of `{{textarea}}` match those of the native HTML tags as
    closely as possible.

    The following HTML attributes can be set:

      * `value`
      * `name`
      * `rows`
      * `cols`
      * `placeholder`
      * `disabled`
      * `maxlength`
      * `tabindex`
      * `selectionEnd`
      * `selectionStart`
      * `selectionDirection`
      * `wrap`
      * `readonly`
      * `autofocus`
      * `form`
      * `spellcheck`
      * `required`

    When set to a quoted string, these value will be directly applied to the HTML
    element. When left unquoted, these values will be bound to a property on the
    template's current rendering context (most typically a controller instance).

    Unbound:

    ```handlebars
    {{textarea value="Lots of static text that ISN'T bound"}}
    ```

    Would result in the following HTML:

    ```html
    <textarea class="ember-text-area">
      Lots of static text that ISN'T bound
    </textarea>
    ```

    Bound:

    In the following example, the `writtenWords` property on `App.ApplicationController`
    will be updated live as the user types 'Lots of text that IS bound' into
    the text area of their browser's window.

    ```javascript
    App.ApplicationController = Ember.Controller.extend({
      writtenWords: "Lots of text that IS bound"
    });
    ```

    ```handlebars
    {{textarea value=writtenWords}}
    ```

     Would result in the following HTML:

    ```html
    <textarea class="ember-text-area">
      Lots of text that IS bound
    </textarea>
    ```

    If you wanted a one way binding between the text area and a div tag
    somewhere else on your screen, you could use `Ember.computed.oneWay`:

    ```javascript
    App.ApplicationController = Ember.Controller.extend({
      writtenWords: "Lots of text that IS bound",
      outputWrittenWords: Ember.computed.oneWay("writtenWords")
    });
    ```

    ```handlebars
    {{textarea value=writtenWords}}
    <div>
      {{outputWrittenWords}}
    </div>
    ```

    Would result in the following HTML:

    ```html
    <textarea class="ember-text-area">
      Lots of text that IS bound
    </textarea>
    <-- the following div will be updated in real time as you type -->
    <div>
      Lots of text that IS bound
    </div>
    ```

    Finally, this example really shows the power and ease of Ember when two
    properties are bound to eachother via `Ember.computed.alias`. Type into
    either text area box and they'll both stay in sync. Note that
    `Ember.computed.alias` costs more in terms of performance, so only use it when
    your really binding in both directions:

    ```javascript
    App.ApplicationController = Ember.Controller.extend({
      writtenWords: "Lots of text that IS bound",
      twoWayWrittenWords: Ember.computed.alias("writtenWords")
    });
    ```

    ```handlebars
    {{textarea value=writtenWords}}
    {{textarea value=twoWayWrittenWords}}
    ```

    ```html
    <textarea id="ember1" class="ember-text-area">
      Lots of text that IS bound
    </textarea>
    <-- both updated in real time -->
    <textarea id="ember2" class="ember-text-area">
      Lots of text that IS bound
    </textarea>
    ```

    ### Actions

    The helper can send multiple actions based on user events.
    The action property defines the action which is send when
    the user presses the return key.

    ```handlebars
    {{input action="submit"}}
    ```

    The helper allows some user events to send actions.

    * `enter`
    * `insert-newline`
    * `escape-press`
    * `focus-in`
    * `focus-out`
    * `key-press`

    For example, if you desire an action to be sent when the input is blurred,
    you only need to setup the action name to the event name property.

    ```handlebars
    {{textarea focus-in="alertMessage"}}
    ```

    See more about [Text Support Actions](/api/classes/Ember.TextArea.html)

    ### Extension

    Internally, `{{textarea}}` creates an instance of `Ember.TextArea`, passing
    arguments from the helper to `Ember.TextArea`'s `create` method. You can
    extend the capabilities of text areas in your application by reopening this
    class. For example, if you are building a Bootstrap project where `data-*`
    attributes are used, you can globally add support for a `data-*` attribute
    on all `{{textarea}}`s' in your app by reopening `Ember.TextArea` or
    `Ember.TextSupport` and adding it to the `attributeBindings` concatenated
    property:

    ```javascript
    Ember.TextArea.reopen({
      attributeBindings: ['data-error']
    });
    ```

    Keep in mind when writing `Ember.TextArea` subclasses that `Ember.TextArea`
    itself extends `Ember.Component`. Expect isolated component semantics, not
    legacy 1.x view semantics (like `controller` being present).

    The `{{action}}` helper provides a way to pass triggers for behavior (usually
    just a function) between components, and into components from controllers.

    ### Passing functions with the action helper

    There are three contexts an action helper can be used in. The first two
    contexts to discuss are attribute context, and Handlebars value context.

    ```handlebars
    {{! An example of attribute context }}
    <div onclick={{action "save"}}></div>
    {{! Examples of Handlebars value context }}
    {{input on-input=(action "save")}}
    {{yield (action "refreshData") andAnotherParam}}
    ```

    In these contexts,
    the helper is called a "closure action" helper. Its behavior is simple:
    If passed a function name, read that function off the `actions` property
    of the current context. Once that function is read (or if a function was
    passed), create a closure over that function and any arguments.
    The resulting value of an action helper used this way is simply a function.

    For example, in the attribute context:

    ```handlebars
    {{! An example of attribute context }}
    <div onclick={{action "save"}}></div>
    ```

    The resulting template render logic would be:

    ```js
    var div = document.createElement('div');
    var actionFunction = (function(context){
      return function() {
        return context.actions.save.apply(context, arguments);
      };
    })(context);
    div.onclick = actionFunction;
    ```

    Thus when the div is clicked, the action on that context is called.
    Because the `actionFunction` is just a function, closure actions can be
    passed between components and still execute in the correct context.

    Here is an example action handler on a component:

    ```js
    export default Ember.Component.extend({
      actions: {
        save() {
          this.get('model').save();
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    Actions are always looked up on the `actions` property of the current context.
    This avoids collisions in the naming of common actions, such as `destroy`.
    Two options can be passed to the `action` helper when it is used in this way.

    * `target=someProperty` will look to `someProperty` instead of the current
      context for the `actions` hash. This can be useful when targetting a
      service for actions.
    * `value="target.value"` will read the path `target.value` off the first
      argument to the action when it is called and rewrite the first argument
      to be that value. This is useful when attaching actions to event listeners.

    ### Invoking an action

    Closure actions curry both their scope and any arguments. When invoked, any
    additional arguments are added to the already curried list.
    Actions should be invoked using the [sendAction](/api/classes/Ember.Component.html#method_sendAction)
    method. The first argument to `sendAction` is the action to be called, and
    additional arguments are passed to the action function. This has interesting
    properties combined with currying of arguments. For example:

    ```js
    export default Ember.Component.extend({
      actions: {
        // Usage {{input on-input=(action (action 'setName' model) value="target.value")}}
        setName(model, name) {
          model.set('name', name);
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    The first argument (`model`) was curried over, and the run-time argument (`event`)
    becomes a second argument. Action calls can be nested this way because each simply
    returns a function. Any function can be passed to the `{{action}}` helper, including
    other actions.

    Actions invoked with `sendAction` have the same currying behavior as demonstrated
    with `on-input` above. For example:

    ```js
    export default Ember.Component.extend({
      actions: {
        setName(model, name) {
          model.set('name', name);
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    ```handlebars
    {{my-input submit=(action 'setName' model)}}
    ```

    ```js
    // app/components/my-component.js
    export default Ember.Component.extend({
      click() {
        // Note that model is not passed, it was curried in the template
        this.sendAction('submit', 'bob');
      }
    });
    ```

    ### Attaching actions to DOM elements

    The third context of the `{{action}}` helper can be called "element space".
    For example:

    ```handlebars
    {{! An example of element space }}
    <div {{action "save"}}></div>
    ```

    Used this way, the `{{action}}` helper provides a useful shortcut for
    registering an HTML element in a template for a single DOM event and
    forwarding that interaction to the template's context (controller or component).
    If the context of a template is a controller, actions used this way will
    bubble to routes when the controller does not implement the specified action.
    Once an action hits a route, it will bubble through the route hierarchy.

    ### Event Propagation

    `{{action}}` helpers called in element space can control event bubbling. Note
    that the closure style actions cannot.

    Events triggered through the action helper will automatically have
    `.preventDefault()` called on them. You do not need to do so in your event
    handlers. If you need to allow event propagation (to handle file inputs for
    example) you can supply the `preventDefault=false` option to the `{{action}}` helper:

    ```handlebars
    <div {{action "sayHello" preventDefault=false}}>
      <input type="file" />
      <input type="checkbox" />
    </div>
    ```

    To disable bubbling, pass `bubbles=false` to the helper:

    ```handlebars
    <button {{action 'edit' post bubbles=false}}>Edit</button>
    ```

    To disable bubbling with closure style actions you must create your own
    wrapper helper that makes use of `event.stopPropagation()`:

    ```handlebars
    <div onclick={{disable-bubbling (action "sayHello")}}>Hello</div>
    ```

    ```js
    // app/helpers/disable-bubbling.js
    import Ember from 'ember';
    export function disableBubbling([action]) {
      return function(event) {
        event.stopPropagation();
        return action(event);
      };
    }
    export default Ember.Helper.helper(disableBubbling);
    ```

    If you need the default handler to trigger you should either register your
    own event handler, or use event methods on your view class. See
    ["Responding to Browser Events"](/api/classes/Ember.View.html#toc_responding-to-browser-events)
    in the documentation for Ember.View for more information.

    ### Specifying DOM event type

    `{{action}}` helpers called in element space can specify an event type.
    By default the `{{action}}` helper registers for DOM `click` events. You can
    supply an `on` option to the helper to specify a different DOM event name:

    ```handlebars
    <div {{action "anActionName" on="doubleClick"}}>
      click me
    </div>
    ```

    See ["Event Names"](/api/classes/Ember.View.html#toc_event-names) for a list of
    acceptable DOM event names.

    ### Specifying whitelisted modifier keys

    `{{action}}` helpers called in element space can specify modifier keys.
    By default the `{{action}}` helper will ignore click events with pressed modifier
    keys. You can supply an `allowedKeys` option to specify which keys should not be ignored.

    ```handlebars
    <div {{action "anActionName" allowedKeys="alt"}}>
      click me
    </div>
    ```

    This way the action will fire when clicking with the alt key pressed down.
    Alternatively, supply "any" to the `allowedKeys` option to accept any combination of modifier keys.

    ```handlebars
    <div {{action "anActionName" allowedKeys="any"}}>
      click me with any key pressed
    </div>
    ```

    ### Specifying a Target

    A `target` option can be provided to the helper to change
    which object will receive the method call. This option must be a path
    to an object, accessible in the current context:

    ```handlebars
    {{! app/templates/application.hbs }}
    <div {{action "anActionName" target=someService}}>
      click me
    </div>
    ```

    ```javascript
    // app/controllers/application.js
    export default Ember.Controller.extend({
      someService: Ember.inject.service()
    });
    ```

    The `{{component}}` helper lets you add instances of `Ember.Component` to a
    template. See [Ember.Component](/api/classes/Ember.Component.html) for
    additional information on how a `Component` functions.
    `{{component}}`'s primary use is for cases where you want to dynamically
    change which type of component is rendered as the state of your application
    changes. This helper has three modes: inline, block, and nested.

    ### Inline Form

    Given the following template:

    ```app/application.hbs
    {{component infographicComponentName}}
    ```

    And the following application code:

    ```app/controllers/application.js
    export default Ember.Controller.extend({
      infographicComponentName: computed('isMarketOpen', {
        get() {
          if (this.get('isMarketOpen')) {
            return 'live-updating-chart';
          } else {
            return 'market-close-summary';
          }
        }
      })
    });
    ```

    The `live-updating-chart` component will be appended when `isMarketOpen` is
    `true`, and the `market-close-summary` component will be appended when
    `isMarketOpen` is `false`. If the value changes while the app is running,
    the component will be automatically swapped out accordingly.
    Note: You should not use this helper when you are consistently rendering the same
    component. In that case, use standard component syntax, for example:

    ```app/templates/application.hbs
    {{live-updating-chart}}
    ```

    ### Block Form

    Using the block form of this helper is similar to using the block form
    of a component. Given the following application template:

    ```app/templates/application.hbs
    {{#component infographicComponentName}}
      Last update: {{lastUpdateTimestamp}}
    {{/component}}
    ```

    The following controller code:

    ```app/controllers/application.js
    export default Ember.Controller.extend({
      lastUpdateTimestamp: computed(function() {
        return new Date();
      }),

      infographicComponentName: computed('isMarketOpen', {
        get() {
          if (this.get('isMarketOpen')) {
            return 'live-updating-chart';
          } else {
            return 'market-close-summary';
          }
        }
      })
    });
    ```

    And the following component template:

    ```app/templates/components/live-updating-chart.hbs
    {{! chart }}
    {{yield}}
    ```

    The `Last Update: {{lastUpdateTimestamp}}` will be rendered in place of the `{{yield}}`.

    ### Nested Usage

    The `component` helper can be used to package a component path with initial attrs.
    The included attrs can then be merged during the final invocation.
    For example, given a `person-form` component with the following template:

    ```app/templates/components/person-form.hbs
    {{yield (hash
      nameInput=(component "my-input-component" value=model.name placeholder="First Name")
    )}}
    ```

    When yielding the component via the `hash` helper, the component is invocked directly.
    See the following snippet:

    ```
    {{#person-form as |form|}}
      {{form.nameInput placeholder="Username"}}
    {{/person-form}}
    ```

    Which outputs an input whose value is already bound to `model.name` and `placeholder`
    is "Username".

    When yielding the component without the hash helper use the `component` helper.
    For example, below is a `full-name` component template:

    ```handlebars
    {{yield (component "my-input-component" value=model.name placeholder="Name")}}
    ```

    ```
    {{#full-name as |field|}}
      {{component field placeholder="Full name"}}
    {{/full-name}}
    ```

    Execute the `debugger` statement in the current template's context.

    ```handlebars
    {{debugger}}
    ```

    When using the debugger helper you will have access to a `get` function. This
    function retrieves values available in the context of the template.
    For example, if you're wondering why a value `{{foo}}` isn't rendering as
    expected within a template, you could place a `{{debugger}}` statement and,
    when the `debugger;` breakpoint is hit, you can attempt to retrieve this value:

    ```
    > get('foo')
    ```

    `get` is also aware of block variables. So in this situation

    ```handlebars
    {{#each items as |item|}}
      {{debugger}}
    {{/each}}
    ```

    You'll be able to get values from the current item:

    ```
    > get('item.name')
    ```

    You can also access the context of the view to make sure it is the object that
    you expect:

    ```
    > context
    ```

    The `{{#each}}` helper loops over elements in a collection. It is an extension
    of the base Handlebars `{{#each}}` helper.
    The default behavior of `{{#each}}` is to yield its inner block once for every
    item in an array passing the item as the first block parameter.

    ```javascript
    var developers = [{ name: 'Yehuda' },{ name: 'Tom' }, { name: 'Paul' }];
    ```

    ```handlebars
    {{#each developers key="name" as |person|}}
      {{person.name}}
      {{! `this` is whatever it was outside the #each }}
    {{/each}}
    ```

    The same rules apply to arrays of primitives.

    ```javascript
    var developerNames = ['Yehuda', 'Tom', 'Paul']
    ```

    ```handlebars
    {{#each developerNames key="@index" as |name|}}
      {{name}}
    {{/each}}
    ```

    During iteration, the index of each item in the array is provided as a second block parameter.

    ```handlebars
    <ul>
      {{#each people as |person index|}}
        <li>Hello, {{person.name}}! You're number {{index}} in line</li>
      {{/each}}
    </ul>
    ```

    ### Specifying Keys

    The `key` option is used to tell Ember how to determine if the array being
    iterated over with `{{#each}}` has changed between renders. By helping Ember
    detect that some elements in the array are the same, DOM elements can be
    re-used, significantly improving rendering speed.

    For example, here's the `{{#each}}` helper with its `key` set to `id`:

    ```handlebars
    {{#each model key="id" as |item|}}
    {{/each}}
    ```

    When this `{{#each}}` re-renders, Ember will match up the previously rendered
    items (and reorder the generated DOM elements) based on each item's `id`
    property.
    By default the item's own reference is used.

    ### {{else}} condition

    `{{#each}}` can have a matching `{{else}}`. The contents of this block will render
    if the collection is empty.

    ```handlebars
    {{#each developers as |person|}}
      {{person.name}}
    {{else}}
      <p>Sorry, nobody is available for this task.</p>
    {{/each}}
    ```

    This template would display all properties on the `user`
    object in a list:

    ```handlebars

    {{#each-in user as |key value|}}
      <li>{{key}}: {{value}}</li>

    Dynamically look up a property on an object. The second argument to `{{get}}`
    should have a string value, although it can be bound.

    For example, these two usages are equivilent:

    ```handlebars
    {{person.height}}
    {{get person "height"}}
    ```

    If there were several facts about a person, the `{{get}}` helper can dynamically
    pick one:

    ```handlebars
    {{get person factName}}
    ```

    For a more complex example, this template would allow the user to switch
    between showing the user's height and weight with a click:

    ```handlebars
    {{get person factName}}
    <button {{action (action (mut factName)) "height"}}>Show height</button>
    <button {{action (action (mut factName)) "weight"}}>Show weight</button>
    ```

    The `{{get}}` helper can also respect mutable values itself. For example:

    ```handlebars
    {{input value=(mut (get person factName)) type="text"}}
    <button {{action (action (mut factName)) "height"}}>Show height</button>
    <button {{action (action (mut factName)) "weight"}}>Show weight</button>
    ```

    Would allow the user to swap what fact is being displayed, and also edit
    that fact via a two-way mutable binding.

    Use the `if` block helper to conditionally render a block depending on a
    property. If the property is "falsey", for example: `false`, `undefined`,
    `null`, `""`, `0`, `NaN` or an empty array, the block will not be rendered.

    ```handlebars
    {{! will not render if foo is falsey}}
    {{#if foo}}
      Welcome to the {{foo.bar}}
    {{/if}}
    ```

    You can also specify a template to show if the property is falsey by using
    the `else` helper.

    ```handlebars
    {{! is it raining outside?}}
    {{#if isRaining}}
      Yes, grab an umbrella!
    {{else}}
      No, it's lovely outside!
    {{/if}}
    ```

    You are also able to combine `else` and `if` helpers to create more complex
    conditional logic.

    ```handlebars
    {{#if isMorning}}
      Good morning
    {{else if isAfternoon}}
      Good afternoon
    {{else}}
      Good night
    {{/if}}
    ```

    You can use `if` inline to conditionally render a single property or string.
    This helper acts like a ternary operator. If the first property is truthy,
    the second argument will be displayed, if not, the third argument will be
    displayed

    ```handlebars
    {{if useLongGreeting "Hello" "Hi"}} Dave
    ```

    Finally, you can use the `if` helper inside another helper as a subexpression.

    ```handlebars
    {{some-component height=(if isBig "100" "10")}}
    ```

  line: 10
  description: |-
    The `mut` helper lets you __clearly specify__ that a child `Component` can update the
    (mutable) value passed to it, which will __change the value of the parent component__.

    To specify that a parameter is mutable, when invoking the child `Component`:

    ```handlebars
    {{my-child childClickCount=(mut totalClicks)}}
    ```

    The child `Component` can then modify the parent's value just by modifying its own
    property:

    ```javascript
    // my-child.js
    export default Component.extend({
      click() {
        this.incrementProperty('childClickCount');
      }
    });
    ```

    Note that for curly components (`{{my-component}}`) the bindings are already mutable,
    making the `mut` unnecessary.

    Additionally, the `mut` helper can be combined with the `action` helper to
    mutate a value. For example:

    ```handlebars
    {{my-child childClickCount=totalClicks click-count-change=(action (mut totalClicks))}}
    ```

    The child `Component` would invoke the action with the new click value:

    ```javascript
    // my-child.js
    export default Component.extend({
      click() {
        this.get('click-count-change')(this.get('childClickCount') + 1);
      }
    });
    ```

    The `mut` helper changes the `totalClicks` value to what was provided as the action argument.

    The `mut` helper, when used with `action`, will return a function that
    sets the value passed to `mut` to its first argument. This works like any other
    closure action and interacts with the other features `action` provides.
    As an example, we can create a button that increments a value passing the value
    directly to the `action`:

    ```handlebars
    {{! inc helper is not provided by Ember }}
    <button onclick={{action (mut count) (inc count)}}>
      Increment count
    </button>
    ```

    You can also use the `value` option:

    ```handlebars
    <input value={{name}} oninput={{action (mut name) value="target.value"}}>
    ```

  name: mut

  line: 9
  description: |-
    The `readonly` helper let's you specify that a binding is one-way only,
    instead of two-way.
    When you pass a `readonly` binding from an outer context (e.g. parent component),
    to to an inner context (e.g. child component), you are saying that changing that
    property in the inner context does not change the value in the outer context.

    To specify that a binding is read-only, when invoking the child `Component`:

    ```app/components/my-parent.js
    export default Component.extend({
      totalClicks: 3
    });
    ```

    ```app/templates/components/my-parent.hbs
    {{log totalClicks}} // -> 3
    {{my-child childClickCount=(readonly totalClicks)}}
    ```

    Now, when you update `childClickCount`:

    ```app/components/my-child.js
    export default Component.extend({
      click() {
        this.incrementProperty('childClickCount');
      }
    });
    ```

    The value updates in the child component, but not the parent component:

    ```app/templates/components/my-child.hbs
    {{log childClickCount}} //-> 4
    ```

    ```app/templates/components/my-parent.hbs
    {{log totalClicks}} //-> 3
    {{my-child childClickCount=(readonly totalClicks)}}
    ```

    ### Objects and Arrays

    When passing a property that is a complex object (e.g. object, array) instead of a primitive object (e.g. number, string),
    only the reference to the object is protected using the readonly helper.
    This means that you can change properties of the object both on the parent component, as well as the child component.
    The `readonly` binding behaves similar to the `const` keyword in JavaScript.

    Let's look at an example:

    First let's set up the parent component:

    ```app/components/my-parent.js
    export default Ember.Component.extend({
      clicks: null,

      init() {
        this._super(...arguments);
        this.set('clicks', { total: 3 });
      }
    });
    ```

    ```app/templates/components/my-parent.hbs
    {{log clicks.total}} //-> 3
    {{my-child childClicks=(readonly clicks)}}
    ```

    Now, if you update the `total` property of `childClicks`:

    ```app/components/my-child.js
    export default Ember.Component.extend({
      click() {
        this.get('clicks').incrementProperty('total');
      }
    });
    ```

    You will see the following happen:

    ```app/templates/components/my-parent.hbs
    {{log clicks.total}} //-> 4
    {{my-child childClicks=(readonly clicks)}}
    ```

    ```app/templates/components/my-child.hbs
    {{log childClicks.total}} //-> 4
    ```

  line: 9
  description: |-
    The `{{unbound}}` helper disconnects the one-way binding of a property,
    essentially freezing its value at the moment of rendering. For example,
    in this example the display of the variable `name` will not change even
    if it is set with a new value:

    ```handlebars
    {{unbound name}}
    ```

    Like any helper, the `unbound` helper can accept a nested helper expression.
    This allows for custom helpers to be rendered unbound:

    ```handlebars
    {{unbound (some-custom-helper)}}
    {{unbound (capitalize name)}}
    {{! You can use any helper, including unbound, in a nested expression }}
    {{capitalize (unbound name)}}
    ```

    The `unbound` helper only accepts a single argument, and it return an
    unbound value.

  description: |-
    The `{{input}}` helper lets you create an HTML `<input />` component.
    It causes an `Ember.TextField` component to be rendered.  For more info,
    see the [Ember.TextField](/api/classes/Ember.TextField.html) docs and
    the [templates guide](http://emberjs.com/guides/templates/input-helpers/).

    ```handlebars
    {{input value="987"}}
    ```

    renders as:

    ```HTML
    <input type="text" value="987" />
    ```

    ### Text field

    If no `type` option is specified, a default of type 'text' is used.
    Many of the standard HTML attributes may be passed to this helper.
    <table>
      <tr><td>`readonly`</td><td>`required`</td><td>`autofocus`</td></tr>
      <tr><td>`value`</td><td>`placeholder`</td><td>`disabled`</td></tr>
      <tr><td>`size`</td><td>`tabindex`</td><td>`maxlength`</td></tr>
      <tr><td>`name`</td><td>`min`</td><td>`max`</td></tr>
      <tr><td>`pattern`</td><td>`accept`</td><td>`autocomplete`</td></tr>
      <tr><td>`autosave`</td><td>`formaction`</td><td>`formenctype`</td></tr>
      <tr><td>`formmethod`</td><td>`formnovalidate`</td><td>`formtarget`</td></tr>
      <tr><td>`height`</td><td>`inputmode`</td><td>`multiple`</td></tr>
      <tr><td>`step`</td><td>`width`</td><td>`form`</td></tr>
      <tr><td>`selectionDirection`</td><td>`spellcheck`</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
    </table>
    When set to a quoted string, these values will be directly applied to the HTML
    element. When left unquoted, these values will be bound to a property on the
    template's current rendering context (most typically a controller instance).
    A very common use of this helper is to bind the `value` of an input to an Object's attribute:

    ```handlebars
    Search:
    {{input value=searchWord}}
    ```

    In this example, the inital value in the `<input />` will be set to the value of `searchWord`.
    If the user changes the text, the value of `searchWord` will also be updated.

    ### Actions

    The helper can send multiple actions based on user events.
    The action property defines the action which is sent when
    the user presses the return key.

    ```handlebars
    {{input action="submit"}}
    ```

    The helper allows some user events to send actions.

    * `enter`
    * `insert-newline`
    * `escape-press`
    * `focus-in`
    * `focus-out`
    * `key-press`
    * `key-up`

    For example, if you desire an action to be sent when the input is blurred,
    you only need to setup the action name to the event name property.

    ```handlebars
    {{input focus-out="alertMessage"}}
    ```
    See more about [Text Support Actions](/api/classes/Ember.TextField.html)

    ### Extending `Ember.TextField`

    Internally, `{{input type="text"}}` creates an instance of `Ember.TextField`, passing
    arguments from the helper to `Ember.TextField`'s `create` method. You can extend the
    capabilities of text inputs in your applications by reopening this class. For example,
    if you are building a Bootstrap project where `data-*` attributes are used, you
    can add one to the `TextField`'s `attributeBindings` property:

    ```javascript
    Ember.TextField.reopen({
      attributeBindings: ['data-error']
    });
    ```

    Keep in mind when writing `Ember.TextField` subclasses that `Ember.TextField`
    itself extends `Ember.Component`. Expect isolated component semantics, not
    legacy 1.x view semantics (like `controller` being present).
    See more about [Ember components](/api/classes/Ember.Component.html)

    ### Checkbox

    Checkboxes are special forms of the `{{input}}` helper.  To create a `<checkbox />`:

    ```handlebars
    Emberize Everything:
    {{input type="checkbox" name="isEmberized" checked=isEmberized}}
    ```

    This will bind checked state of this checkbox to the value of `isEmberized`  -- if either one changes,
    it will be reflected in the other.

    The following HTML attributes can be set via the helper:

    * `checked`
    * `disabled`
    * `tabindex`
    * `indeterminate`
    * `name`
    * `autofocus`
    * `form`

    ### Extending `Ember.Checkbox`

    Internally, `{{input type="checkbox"}}` creates an instance of `Ember.Checkbox`, passing
    arguments from the helper to `Ember.Checkbox`'s `create` method. You can extend the
    capablilties of checkbox inputs in your applications by reopening this class. For example,
    if you wanted to add a css class to all checkboxes in your application:

    ```javascript
    Ember.Checkbox.reopen({
      classNames: ['my-app-checkbox']
    });
    ```

    ```handlebars

    The `{{outlet}}` helper lets you specify where a child route will render in
    your template. An important use of the `{{outlet}}` helper is in your
    application's `application.hbs` file:

    ```handlebars
    {{! app/templates/application.hbs }}
    <!-- header content goes here, and will always display -->
    {{my-header}}
    <div class="my-dynamic-content">
      <!-- this content will change based on the current route, which depends on the current URL -->
      {{outlet}}
    </div>
    <!-- footer content goes here, and will always display -->
    {{my-footer}}
    ```

    See [templates guide](http://emberjs.com/guides/templates/the-application-template/) for
    additional information on using `{{outlet}}` in `application.hbs`.
    You may also specify a name for the `{{outlet}}`, which is useful when using more than one
    `{{outlet}}` in a template:

    ```handlebars
    {{outlet "menu"}}
    {{outlet "sidebar"}}
    {{outlet "main"}}
    ```

    Your routes can then render into a specific one of these `outlet`s by specifying the `outlet`
    attribute in your `renderTemplate` function:

    ```javascript
    // app/routes/menu.js
    export default Ember.Route.extend({
      renderTemplate() {
        this.render({ outlet: 'menu' });
      }
    });
    ```

    See the [routing guide](http://emberjs.com/guides/routing/rendering-a-template/) for more
    information on how your `route` interacts with the `{{outlet}}` helper.
    Note: Your content __will not render__ if there isn't an `{{outlet}}` for it.

    Calling ``{{render}}`` from within a template will insert another
    template that matches the provided name. The inserted template will
    access its properties on its own controller (rather than the controller
    of the parent template).

    If a view class with the same name exists, the view class also will be used.
    Note: A given controller may only be used *once* in your app in this manner.
    A singleton instance of the controller will be created for you.

    Example:

    ```javascript
    App.NavigationController = Ember.Controller.extend({
      who: "world"
    });
    ```

    ```handlebars
    <!-- navigation.hbs -->
    Hello, {{who}}.
    ```

    ```handlebars
    <!-- application.hbs -->
    <h1>My great app</h1>
    {{render "navigation"}}
    ```

    ```html
    <h1>My great app</h1>
    <div class='ember-view'>
      Hello, world.
    </div>
    ```

    Optionally you may provide a second argument: a property path
    that will be bound to the `model` property of the controller.
    If a `model` property path is specified, then a new instance of the
    controller will be created and `{{render}}` can be used multiple times
    with the same name.

    For example if you had this `author` template.

    ```handlebars
    <div class="author">
      Written by {{firstName}} {{lastName}}.
      Total Posts: {{postCount}}
    </div>
    ```

    You could render it inside the `post` template using the `render` helper.

    ```handlebars
    <div class="post">
      <h1>{{title}}</h1>
      <div>{{body}}</div>
      {{render "author" author}}
    </div>

    Normally, Ember's component model is "write-only". The component takes a
    bunch of attributes that it got passed in, and uses them to render its
    template.

    One nice thing about this model is that if you try to set a value to the
    same thing as last time, Ember (through HTMLBars) will avoid doing any
    work on the DOM.

    This is not just a performance optimization. If an attribute has not
    changed, it is important not to clobber the element's "hidden state".
    For example, if you set an input's `value` to the same value as before,
    it will clobber selection state and cursor position. In other words,
    setting an attribute is not **always** idempotent.

    This method provides a way to read an element's attribute and also
    update the last value Ember knows about at the same time. This makes
    setting an attribute idempotent.

    In particular, what this means is that if you get an `<input>` element's
    `value` attribute and then re-render the template with the same value,

    Enables components to take a list of parameters as arguments.
    For example, a component that takes two parameters with the names
    `name` and `age`:

    ```javascript
    let MyComponent = Ember.Component.extend;
    MyComponent.reopenClass({
    positionalParams: ['name', 'age']
    });
    ```

    It can then be invoked like this:

    ```hbs
    {{my-component "John" 38}}
    ```

    The parameters can be referred to just like named parameters:

    ```hbs
    Name: {{attrs.name}}, Age: {{attrs.age}}.
    ```

    Using a string instead of an array allows for an arbitrary number of
    parameters:

    ```javascript
    let MyComponent = Ember.Component.extend;
    MyComponent.reopenClass({
    positionalParams: 'names'
    });
    ```

    It can then be invoked like this:

    ```hbs
    {{my-component "John" "Michael" "Scott"}}
    ```
    The parameters can then be referred to by enumerating over the list:

    ```hbs
    {{#each attrs.names as |name|}}{{name}}{{/each}}
    ```

    Use the `{{with}}` helper when you want to alias a property to a new name. This is helpful
    for semantic clarity as it allows you to retain default scope or to reference a property from another
    `{{with}}` block.

    If the aliased property is "falsey", for example: `false`, `undefined` `null`, `""`, `0`, NaN or
    an empty array, the block will not be rendered.

    ```handlebars
    {{! Will only render if user.posts contains items}}
    {{#with user.posts as |blogPosts|}}
      <div class="notice">
        There are {{blogPosts.length}} blog posts written by {{user.name}}.
      </div>
      {{#each blogPosts as |post|}}
        <li>{{post.title}}</li>
      {{/each}}
    {{/with}}
    ```

    Without the `as` operator, it would be impossible to reference `user.name` in the example above.

    NOTE: The alias should not reuse a name from the bound property path.

    For example: `{{#with foo.bar as |foo|}}` is not supported because it attempts to alias using
    the first part of the property path, `foo`. Instead, use `{{#with foo.bar as |baz|}}`.

    Execute the `debugger` statement in the current template's context.

    ```handlebars
    {{debugger}}
    ```

    When using the debugger helper you will have access to a `get` function. This
    function retrieves values available in the context of the template.
    For example, if you're wondering why a value `{{foo}}` isn't rendering as
    expected within a template, you could place a `{{debugger}}` statement and,
    when the `debugger;` breakpoint is hit, you can attempt to retrieve this value:

    ```
    > get('foo')
    ```

    `get` is also aware of keywords. So in this situation

    ```handlebars
    {{#each items as |item|}}
      {{debugger}}
    {{/each}}
    ```

    You'll be able to get values from the current item:

    ```
    > get('item.name')
    ```

    You can also access the context of the view to make sure it is the object that
    you expect:

    ```
    > context
    ```

    The `partial` helper renders another template without
    changing the template context:

    ```handlebars
    {{foo}}
    {{partial "nav"}}
    ```

    The above example template will render a template named
    "-nav", which has the same context as the parent template
    it's rendered into, so if the "-nav" template also referenced
    `{{foo}}`, it would print the same thing as the `{{foo}}`
    in the above example.

    If a "-nav" template isn't found, the `partial` helper will
    fall back to a template named "nav".

    ### Bound template names

    The parameter supplied to `partial` can also be a path
    to a property containing a template name, e.g.:

    ```handlebars
    {{partial someTemplateName}}
    ```

    The above example will look up the value of `someTemplateName`
    on the template context (e.g. a controller) and use that
    value as the name of the template to render. If the resolved
    value is falsy, nothing will be rendered. If `someTemplateName`
    changes, the partial will be re-rendered using the new template
    name.

    Create a bound helper. Accepts a function that receives the ordered and hash parameters
    from the template. If a bound property was provided in the template, it will be resolved to its
    value and any changes to the bound property cause the helper function to be re-run with the updated
    values.

    * `params` - An array of resolved ordered parameters.
    * `hash` - An object containing the hash parameters.

    For example:

    * With an unquoted ordered parameter:

      ```javascript
      {{x-capitalize foo}}
      ```

      Assuming `foo` was set to `"bar"`, the bound helper would receive `["bar"]` as its first argument, and
      an empty hash as its second.

    * With a quoted ordered parameter:

      ```javascript
      {{x-capitalize "foo"}}
      ```

      The bound helper would receive `["foo"]` as its first argument, and an empty hash as its second.

    * With an unquoted hash parameter:

      ```javascript
      {{x-repeat "foo" count=repeatCount}}
      ```

      Assuming that `repeatCount` resolved to 2, the bound helper would receive `["foo"]` as its first argument,
      and { count: 2 } as its second.

    In some cases, you may want to annotate computed properties with additional
    metadata about how they function or what values they operate on. For example,
    computed property functions may close over variables that are then no longer
    available for introspection.

    You can pass a hash of these values to a computed property like this:

    ```
    person: Ember.computed(function() {
      let personId = this.get('personId');
      return App.Person.create({ id: personId });
    }).meta({ type: App.Person })
    ```

    The hash that you pass to the `meta()` function will be saved on the
    computed property descriptor under the `_meta` key. Ember runtime
    exposes a public API for retrieving these values from classes,
    via the `metaForProperty()` function.

    NOTE: This is a low-level method used by other parts of the API. You almost
    never want to call this method directly. Instead you should use
    `Ember.mixin()` to define new properties.

    Defines a property on an object. This method works much like the ES5
    `Object.defineProperty()` method except that it can also accept computed
    properties and other special descriptors.

    Normally this method takes only three parameters. However if you pass an
    instance of `Descriptor` as the third param then you can pass an
    optional value as the fourth parameter. This is often more efficient than
    creating new descriptor hashes for each property.

    ## Examples

    ```javascript
    // ES5 compatible mode
    Ember.defineProperty(contact, 'firstName', {
      writable: true,
      configurable: false,
      enumerable: true,
      value: 'Charles'
    });

    // define a simple property
    Ember.defineProperty(contact, 'lastName', undefined, 'Jolley');

    // define a computed property
    Ember.defineProperty(contact, 'fullName', Ember.computed('firstName', 'lastName', function() {
      return this.firstName+' '+this.lastName;
    }));
    ```

    Allows you to specify which context to call the specified function in while
    adding the execution of that function to the Ember run loop. This ability
    makes this method a great way to asynchronously integrate third-party libraries
    into your Ember application.

    `run.bind` takes two main arguments, the desired context and the function to
    invoke in that context. Any additional arguments will be supplied as arguments
    to the function that is passed in.

    Let's use the creation of a TinyMCE component as an example. Currently,
    TinyMCE provides a setup configuration option we can use to do some processing
    after the TinyMCE instance is initialized but before it is actually rendered.
    We can use that setup option to do some additional setup for our component.
    The component itself could look something like the following:

    ```javascript
    App.RichTextEditorComponent = Ember.Component.extend({
      initializeTinyMCE: Ember.on('didInsertElement', function() {
        tinymce.init({
          selector: '#' + this.$().prop('id'),
          setup: Ember.run.bind(this, this.setupEditor)
        });
      }),

      setupEditor: function(editor) {
        this.set('editor', editor);

        editor.on('change', function() {
          console.log('content changed!');
        });
      }
    });
    ```

    In this example, we use Ember.run.bind to bind the setupEditor method to the
    context of the App.RichTextEditorComponent and to have the invocation of that
    method be safely handled and executed by the Ember run loop.

      console.log('scheduled on actions queue');
    });

    // Note the functions will be run in order based on the run queues order.

    Schedules a function to run one time in a given queue of the current RunLoop.
    Calling this method with the same queue/target/method combination will have
    no effect (past the initial call).

    Note that although you can pass optional arguments these will not be
    considered when looking for duplicates. New arguments will replace previous
    calls.

    ```javascript
    function sayHi() {
      console.log('hi');
    }

    run(function() {
      run.scheduleOnce('afterRender', myContext, sayHi);
      run.scheduleOnce('afterRender', myContext, sayHi);
      // sayHi will only be executed once, in the afterRender queue of the RunLoop
    });
    ```

    Also note that passing an anonymous function to `run.scheduleOnce` will
    not prevent additional calls with an identical anonymous function from
    scheduling the items multiple times, e.g.:

    ```javascript
    function scheduleIt() {
      run.scheduleOnce('actions', myContext, function() {
        console.log('Closure');
      });
    }

    scheduleIt();
    scheduleIt();

    // "Closure" will print twice, even though we're using `run.scheduleOnce`,
    // because the function we pass to it is anonymous and won't match the
    // previously scheduled operation.
    ```

    Schedules an item to run from within a separate run loop, after
    control has been returned to the system. This is equivalent to calling
    `run.later` with a wait time of 1ms.

    ```javascript
    run.next(myContext, function() {
      // code to be executed in the next run loop,
      // which will be scheduled after the current one
    });
    ```

    Multiple operations scheduled with `run.next` will coalesce
    into the same later run loop, along with any other operations
    scheduled by `run.later` that expire right around the same
    time that `run.next` operations will fire.

    Note that there are often alternatives to using `run.next`.
    For instance, if you'd like to schedule an operation to happen
    after all DOM element operations have completed within the current
    run loop, you can make use of the `afterRender` run loop queue (added
    by the `ember-views` package, along with the preceding `render` queue
    where all the DOM element operations happen).

    Example:

    ```javascript
    export default Ember.Component.extend({
      didInsertElement() {
        this._super(...arguments);
        run.scheduleOnce('afterRender', this, 'processChildElements');
      },

      processChildElements() {
        // ... do something with component's child component
        // elements after they've finished rendering, which
        // can't be done within this component's
        // `didInsertElement` hook because that gets run
        // before the child elements have been added to the DOM.
      }
    });
    ```

    One benefit of the above approach compared to using `run.next` is
    that you will be able to perform DOM/CSS operations before unprocessed
    elements are rendered to the screen, which may prevent flickering or
    other artifacts caused by delaying processing until after rendering.

    The other major benefit to the above approach is that `run.next`
    introduces an element of non-determinism, which can make things much
    harder to test, due to its reliance on `setTimeout`; it's much harder
    to guarantee the order of scheduled operations when they are scheduled
    outside of the current run loop, i.e. with `run.next`.

    Delay calling the target method until the debounce period has elapsed
    with no additional debounce calls. If `debounce` is called again before
    the specified time has elapsed, the timer is reset and the entire period
    must pass again before the target method is called.

    This method should be used when an event may be called multiple times
    but the action should only be called once when the event is done firing.
    A common example is for scroll events where you only want updates to
    happen once scrolling has ceased.

    ```javascript
    function whoRan() {
      console.log(this.name + ' ran.');
    }

    let myContext = { name: 'debounce' };

    run.debounce(myContext, whoRan, 150);

    // less than 150ms passes
    run.debounce(myContext, whoRan, 150);

    // 150ms passes
    // whoRan is invoked with context myContext
    // console logs 'debounce ran.' one time.
    ```

    Immediate allows you to run the function immediately, but debounce
    other calls for this function until the wait time has elapsed. If
    `debounce` is called again before the specified time has elapsed,
    the timer is reset and the entire period must pass again before
    the method can be called again.

    ```javascript
    function whoRan() {
      console.log(this.name + ' ran.');
    }

    let myContext = { name: 'debounce' };

    run.debounce(myContext, whoRan, 150, true);

    // console logs 'debounce ran.' one time immediately.
    // 100ms passes
    run.debounce(myContext, whoRan, 150, true);

    // 150ms passes and nothing else is logged to the console and

    run.debounce(myContext, whoRan, 150, true);

    aController.transitionToRoute('blogComment', aPost, aComment);
    aController.transitionToRoute('blogComment', 1, 13);
    ```

    It is also possible to pass a URL (a string that starts with a
    `/`). This is intended for testing and debugging purposes and

    ```javascript
    aController.transitionToRoute('blogPost', 1, {

    be treated as an identifier instead. In this case, the `model`
    hook of the route will be triggered:

    ```javascript
    aController.replaceRoute('blogPost', 1);
    ```

    Multiple models will be applied last to first recursively up the
    route tree.

    ```javascript
    App.Router.map(function() {
      this.route('blogPost', { path: ':blogPostId' }, function() {
        this.route('blogComment', { path: ':blogCommentId', resetNamespace: true });
      });
    });

    aController.replaceRoute('blogComment', aPost, aComment);
    aController.replaceRoute('blogComment', 1, 13);
    ```

    It is also possible to pass a URL (a string that starts with a
    `/`). This is intended for testing and debugging purposes and
    should rarely be used in production code.

    ```javascript
    aController.replaceRoute('/');
    aController.replaceRoute('/blog/post/1/comment/13');
    ```

    The name of the controller to associate with this route.

    By default, Ember will lookup a route's controller that matches the name
    of the route (i.e. `App.PostController` for `App.PostRoute`). However,
    if you would like to define a specific controller to use, you can do so
    using this property.

    This is useful in many ways, as the controller specified will be:

    * passed to the `setupController` method.
    * used as the controller for the template being rendered by the route.
    * returned from a call to `controllerFor` for the route.

    The `willTransition` action is fired at the beginning of any
    attempted transition with a `Transition` object as the sole
    argument. This action can be used for aborting, redirecting,
    or decorating the transition from the currently active routes.

    A good example is preventing navigation when a form is
    half-filled out:

    ```app/routes/contact-form.js
    import Ember from 'ember';

    export default Ember.Route.extend({
      actions: {
        willTransition(transition) {
          if (this.controller.get('userHasEnteredData')) {
            this.controller.displayNavigationConfirm();
            transition.abort();
          }
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    You can also redirect elsewhere by calling
    `this.transitionTo('elsewhere')` from within `willTransition`.
    Note that `willTransition` will not be fired for the
    redirecting `transitionTo`, since `willTransition` doesn't
    fire when there is already a transition underway. If you want
    subsequent `willTransition` actions to fire for the redirecting
    transition, you must first explicitly call
    `transition.abort()`.

    To allow the `willTransition` event to continue bubbling to the parent
    route, use `return true;`. When the `willTransition` method has a
    return value of `true` then the parent route's `willTransition` method
    will be fired, enabling "bubbling" behavior for the event.

    The `didTransition` action is fired after a transition has

    have resolved. The `didTransition` action has no arguments,
    however, it can be useful for tracking page views or resetting
    state on the controller.

    ```app/routes/login.js

    When attempting to transition into a route, any of the hooks
    may return a promise that rejects, at which point an `error`
    action will be fired on the partially-entered routes, allowing
    for per-route error handling logic, or shared error handling
    logic defined on a parent route.

    Here is an example of an error handler that will be invoked
    for rejected promises from the various hooks on the route,
    as well as any unhandled errors from child routes:

    ```app/routes/admin.js
    import Ember from 'ember';

    export default Ember.Route.extend({
      beforeModel() {
        return Ember.RSVP.reject('bad things!');
      },

      actions: {
        error(error, transition) {
          // Assuming we got here due to the error in `beforeModel`,
          // we can expect that error === "bad things!",
          // but a promise model rejecting would also
          // call this hook, as would any errors encountered
          // in `afterModel`.

          // The `error` hook is also provided the failed
          // `transition`, which can be stored and later
          // `.retry()`d if desired.

          this.transitionTo('login');
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    `error` actions that bubble up all the way to `ApplicationRoute`
    will fire a default error handler that logs the error. You can
    specify your own global default error handler by overriding the
    `error` handler on `ApplicationRoute`:

    ```app/routes/application.js
    import Ember from 'ember';

    export default Ember.Route.extend({
      actions: {
        error(error, transition) {
          this.controllerFor('banner').displayError(error.message);
        }
      }
    });

    Transition the application into another route. The route may
    be either a single route or route path:

    ```javascript
    this.transitionTo('blogPosts');
    this.transitionTo('blogPosts.recentEntries');
    ```

    Optionally supply a model for the route in question. The model
    will be serialized into the URL using the `serialize` hook of
    the route:

    ```javascript
    this.transitionTo('blogPost', aPost);
    ```

    If a literal is passed (such as a number or a string), it will
    be treated as an identifier instead. In this case, the `model`
    hook of the route will be triggered:

    ```javascript
    this.transitionTo('blogPost', 1);
    ```

    Multiple models will be applied last to first recursively up the
    route tree.

    ```app/routes.js
    // ...

    Router.map(function() {
      this.route('blogPost', { path:':blogPostId' }, function() {
        this.route('blogComment', { path: ':blogCommentId' });
      });
    });

    export default Router;
    ```

    ```javascript
    this.transitionTo('blogComment', aPost, aComment);
    this.transitionTo('blogComment', 1, 13);
    ```

    It is also possible to pass a URL (a string that starts with a
    `/`). This is intended for testing and debugging purposes and
    should rarely be used in production code.

    ```javascript
    this.transitionTo('/');
    this.transitionTo('/blog/post/1/comment/13');
    this.transitionTo('/blog/posts?sort=title');
    ```

    An options hash with a `queryParams` property may be provided as
    the final argument to add query parameters to the destination URL.

    ```javascript
    this.transitionTo('blogPost', 1, {
      queryParams: { showComments: 'true' }
    });

    // if you just want to transition the query parameters without changing the route
    this.transitionTo({ queryParams: { sort: 'date' } });
    ```

    See also [replaceWith](#method_replaceWith).

    Simple Transition Example

    ```app/routes.js
    // ...

    Router.map(function() {
      this.route('index');
      this.route('secret');
      this.route('fourOhFour', { path: '*:' });
    });

    export default Router;
    ```

    ```app/routes/index.js
    import Ember from 'ember':

    export Ember.Route.extend({
      actions: {
        moveToSecret(context) {
          if (authorized()) {
            this.transitionTo('secret', context);
          } else {
            this.transitionTo('fourOhFour');
          }
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    Transition to a nested route

    ```app/router.js
    // ...

    Router.map(function() {
      this.route('articles', { path: '/articles' }, function() {
        this.route('new');
      });
    });

    export default Router;
    ```

    ```app/routes/index.js
    import Ember from 'ember';

    export default Ember.Route.extend({
      actions: {
        transitionToNewArticle() {
          this.transitionTo('articles.new');
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    Multiple Models Example

    ```app/router.js
    // ...

    Router.map(function() {
      this.route('index');

      this.route('breakfast', { path: ':breakfastId' }, function() {
        this.route('cereal', { path: ':cerealId' });
      });
    });

    export default Router;
    ```

    ```app/routes/index.js
    import Ember from 'ember';

    export default Ember.Route.extend({
      actions: {
        moveToChocolateCereal() {
          let cereal = { cerealId: 'ChocolateYumminess' };
          let breakfast = { breakfastId: 'CerealAndMilk' };

          this.transitionTo('breakfast.cereal', breakfast, cereal);
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    This hook is the first of the route entry validation hooks
    called when an attempt is made to transition into a route
    or one of its children. It is called before `model` and
    `afterModel`, and is appropriate for cases when:

    1) A decision can be made to redirect elsewhere without
       needing to resolve the model first.
    2) Any async operations need to occur first before the
       model is attempted to be resolved.

    This hook is provided the current `transition` attempt
    as a parameter, which can be used to `.abort()` the transition,
    save it for a later `.retry()`, or retrieve values set
    on it from a previous hook. You can also just call
    `this.transitionTo` to another route to implicitly
    abort the `transition`.

    You can return a promise from this hook to pause the
    transition until the promise resolves (or rejects). This could
    be useful, for instance, for retrieving async code from
    the server that is required to enter a route.

    It follows identical async/promise semantics to `beforeModel`
    but is provided the route's resolved model in addition to
    the `transition`, and is therefore suited to performing
    logic that can only take place after the model has already
    resolved.

    A hook you can implement to optionally redirect to another route.

    If you call `this.transitionTo` from inside of this hook, this route
    will not be entered in favor of the other hook.

    `redirect` and `afterModel` behave very similarly and are
    called almost at the same time, but they have an important
    distinction in the case that, from one of these hooks, a
    redirect into a child route of this route occurs: redirects
    from `afterModel` essentially invalidate the current attempt
    to enter this route, and will result in this route's `beforeModel`,
    `model`, and `afterModel` hooks being fired again within
    the new, redirecting transition. Redirects that occur within
    the `redirect` hook, on the other hand, will _not_ cause
    these hooks to be fired again the second time around; in
    other words, by the time the `redirect` hook has been called,
    both the resolved model and attempted entry into this route
    are considered to be fully validated.

    A hook you can implement to convert the URL into the model for
    this route.

    ```app/router.js
    // ...

    Router.map(function() {
      this.route('post', { path: '/posts/:post_id' });
    });

    export default Router;
    ```

    The model for the `post` route is `store.findRecord('post', params.post_id)`.

    By default, if your route has a dynamic segment ending in `_id`:

    * The model class is determined from the segment (`post_id`'s
      class is `App.Post`)
    * The find method is called on the model class with the value of
      the dynamic segment.

    Note that for routes with dynamic segments, this hook is not always
    executed. If the route is entered through a transition (e.g. when
    using the `link-to` Handlebars helper or the `transitionTo` method
    of routes), and a model context is already provided this hook
    is not called.

    A model context does not include a primitive string or number,
    which does cause the model hook to be called.

    Routes without dynamic segments will always execute the model hook.

    ```javascript
    // no dynamic segment, model hook always called
    this.transitionTo('posts');

    // model passed in, so model hook not called
    thePost = store.findRecord('post', 1);
    this.transitionTo('post', thePost);

    // integer passed in, model hook is called
    this.transitionTo('post', 1);

    // model id passed in, model hook is called
    // useful for forcing the hook to execute
    thePost = store.findRecord('post', 1);
    this.transitionTo('post', thePost.id);
    ```


    This hook follows the asynchronous/promise semantics
    described in the documentation for `beforeModel`. In particular,
    if a promise returned from `model` fails, the error will be
    handled by the `error` hook on `Ember.Route`.

    Example

    ```app/routes/post.js
    import Ember from 'ember';

    export default Ember.Route.extend({
      model(params) {
        return this.store.findRecord('post', params.post_id);

    });
    ```

    will return `Ember.getProperties(model, params)`

    A hook you can use to setup the controller for the current route.

    This method is called with the controller for the current route and the
    model supplied by the `model` hook.

    By default, the `setupController` hook sets the `model` property of
    the controller to the `model`.

    If you implement the `setupController` hook in your Route, it will
    prevent this default behavior. If you want to preserve that behavior
    when implementing your `setupController` function, make sure to call
    `_super`:

    ```app/routes/photos.js
    import Ember from 'ebmer';

    export default Ember.Route.extend({
      model() {
        return this.store.findAll('photo');
      },

      setupController(controller, model) {
        // Call _super for default behavior
        this._super(controller, model);
        // Implement your custom setup after
        this.controllerFor('application').set('showingPhotos', true);
      }
    });
    ```

    The provided controller will be one resolved based on the name
    of this route.

    If no explicit controller is defined, Ember will automatically create one.

    As an example, consider the router:

    ```app/router.js
    // ...

    Router.map(function() {
      this.route('post', { path: '/posts/:post_id' });
    });

    export default Router;
    ```

    For the `post` route, a controller named `App.PostController` would
    be used if it is defined. If it is not defined, a basic `Ember.Controller`
    instance would be used.

    Example

    ```app/routes/post.js
    import Ember from 'ember';

    export default Ember.Route.extend({
      setupController(controller, model) {
        controller.set('model', model);
      }
    });

    `render` is used to render a template into a region of another template
    (indicated by an `{{outlet}}`). `render` is used both during the entry
    phase of routing (via the `renderTemplate` hook) and later in response to
    user interaction.

    For example, given the following minimal router and templates:

    ```app/router.js
    // ...

    Router.map(function() {
      this.route('photos');
    });

    export default Router;
    ```

    ```handlebars
    <!-- application.hbs -->
    <div class='something-in-the-app-hbs'>
      {{outlet "anOutletName"}}
    </div>
    ```

    ```handlebars
    <!-- photos.hbs -->
    <h1>Photos</h1>
    ```

    You can render `photos.hbs` into the `"anOutletName"` outlet of
    `application.hbs` by calling `render`:

    ```app/routes/post.js
    import Ember from 'ember';

    export default Ember.Route.extend({
      renderTemplate() {
        this.render('photos', {
          into: 'application',
          outlet: 'anOutletName'
        })
      }
    });
    ```

    `render` additionally allows you to supply which `controller` and
    `model` objects should be loaded and associated with the rendered template.


    ```app/routes/posts.js
    import Ember from 'ember';

    export default Ember.Route.extend({
      renderTemplate(controller, model){
        this.render('posts', {    // the template to render, referenced by name
          into: 'application',    // the template to render into, referenced by name
          outlet: 'anOutletName', // the outlet inside `options.template` to render into.
          controller: 'someControllerName', // the controller to use for this template, referenced by name
          model: model            // the model to set on `options.controller`.
        })
      }
    });
    ```

    The string values provided for the template name, and controller
    will eventually pass through to the resolver for lookup. See
    Ember.Resolver for how these are mapped to JavaScript objects in your
    application. The template to render into needs to be related to  either the
    current route or one of its ancestors.

    Not all options need to be passed to `render`. Default values will be used
    based on the name of the route specified in the router or the Route's
    `controllerName` and `templateName` properties.

    For example:

    ```app/router.js
    // ...

    Router.map(function() {
      this.route('index');
      this.route('post', { path: '/posts/:post_id' });
    });

    export default Router;
    ```

    ```app/routes/post.js
    import Ember from 'ember';

    export default Ember.Route.extend({
      renderTemplate() {
        this.render(); // all defaults apply
      }
    });
    ```

    The name of the route, defined by the router, is `post`.

    The following equivalent default options will be applied when
    the Route calls `render`:

    ```javascript
    this.render('post', {  // the template name associated with 'post' Route
      into: 'application', // the parent route to 'post' Route
      outlet: 'main',      // {{outlet}} and {{outlet 'main'}} are synonymous,
      controller: 'post',  // the controller associated with the 'post' Route
    })
    ```

    By default the controller's `model` will be the route's model, so it does not
    need to be passed unless you wish to change which model is being used.

    Disconnects a view that has been rendered into an outlet.

    You may pass any or all of the following options to `disconnectOutlet`:

    * `outlet`: the name of the outlet to clear (default: 'main')
    * `parentView`: the name of the view containing the outlet to clear
       (default: the view rendered by the parent route)

    Example:

    ```app/routes/application.js
    import Ember from 'ember';

    export default App.Route.extend({
      actions: {
        showModal(evt) {
          this.render(evt.modalName, {
            outlet: 'modal',
            into: 'application'
          });
        },
        hideModal(evt) {
          this.disconnectOutlet({
            outlet: 'modal',
            parentView: 'application'
          });
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    Alternatively, you can pass the `outlet` name directly as a string.

    Example:

    ```app/routes/application.js
    import Ember from 'ember';

    export default App.Route.extend({
      actions: {
        showModal(evt) {

    The `location` property determines the type of URL's that your
    application will use.

    The following location types are currently available:

    * `history` - use the browser's history API to make the URLs look just like any standard URL
    * `hash` - use `#` to separate the server part of the URL from the Ember part: `/blog/#/posts/new`
    * `none` - do not store the Ember URL in the actual browser URL (mainly used for testing)
    * `auto` - use the best option based on browser capabilites: `history` if possible, then `hash` if possible, otherwise `none`

    Note: If using ember-cli, this value is defaulted to `auto` by the `locationType` setting of `/config/environment.js`

    The `Router.map` function allows you to define mappings from URLs to routes
    in your application. These mappings are defined within the
    supplied callback function using `this.route`.

    The first parameter is the name of the route which is used by default as the
    path name as well.

    The second parameter is the optional options hash. Available options are:

      * `path`: allows you to provide your own path as well as mark dynamic
        segments.
      * `resetNamespace`: false by default; when nesting routes, ember will
        combine the route names to form the fully-qualified route name, which is
        used with `{{link-to}}` or manually transitioning to routes. Setting
        `resetNamespace: true` will cause the route not to inherit from its
        parent route's names. This is handy for preventing extremely long route names.
        Keep in mind that the actual URL path behavior is still retained.

    The third parameter is a function, which can be used to nest routes.
    Nested routes, by default, will have the parent route tree's route name and
    path prepended to it's own.

    ```javascript
    App.Router.map(function(){
      this.route('post', { path: '/post/:post_id' }, function() {
        this.route('edit');
        this.route('comments', { resetNamespace: true }, function() {
          this.route('new');
        });
      });
    });
    ```

    become the value set. This causes the downstream property to permanently
    diverge from the upstream property.

    A computed property which returns a new array with all the
    properties from the first dependent array sorted based on a property
    or sort function.

    The callback method you provide should have the following signature:

    ```javascript
    function(itemA, itemB);
    ```

    - `itemA` the first item to compare.
    - `itemB` the second item to compare.

    This function should return negative number (e.g. `-1`) when `itemA` should come before
    `itemB`. It should return positive number (e.g. `1`) when `itemA` should come after
    `itemB`. If the `itemA` and `itemB` are equal this function should return `0`.

    Therefore, if this function is comparing some numeric values, simple `itemA - itemB` or
    `itemA.get( 'foo' ) - itemB.get( 'foo' )` can be used instead of series of `if`.

    Example

    ```javascript
    let ToDoList = Ember.Object.extend({
      // using standard ascending sort
      todosSorting: ['name'],
      sortedTodos: Ember.computed.sort('todos', 'todosSorting'),

      // using descending sort
      todosSortingDesc: ['name:desc'],
      sortedTodosDesc: Ember.computed.sort('todos', 'todosSortingDesc'),

        if (a.priority > b.priority) {
          return 1;
        } else if (a.priority < b.priority) {
          return -1;
        }

        return 0;
      })
    });

    The `property` extension of Javascript's Function prototype is available
    when `EmberENV.EXTEND_PROTOTYPES` or `EmberENV.EXTEND_PROTOTYPES.Function` is
    `true`, which is the default.

    Computed properties allow you to treat a function like a property:

    ```javascript
    MyApp.President = Ember.Object.extend({
      firstName: '',
      lastName:  '',

      fullName: function() {
        return this.get('firstName') + ' ' + this.get('lastName');
      }.property() // Call this flag to mark the function as a property
    });

    let president = MyApp.President.create({
      firstName: 'Barack',
      lastName: 'Obama'
    });

    president.get('fullName'); // 'Barack Obama'
    ```

    Treating a function like a property is useful because they can work with
    bindings, just like any other property.

    Many computed properties have dependencies on other properties. For
    example, in the above example, the `fullName` property depends on
    `firstName` and `lastName` to determine its value. You can tell Ember
    about these dependencies like this:

    ```javascript
    MyApp.President = Ember.Object.extend({
      firstName: '',
      lastName:  '',

      fullName: function() {
        return this.get('firstName') + ' ' + this.get('lastName');

        // Tell Ember.js that this computed property depends on firstName
        // and lastName
      }.property('firstName', 'lastName')
    });
    ```

    Make sure you list these dependencies so Ember knows when to update
    bindings that connect to a computed property. Changing a dependency
    will not immediately trigger an update of the computed property, but
    will instead clear the cache so that it is updated when the next `get`
    is called on the property.

    The `observes` extension of Javascript's Function prototype is available
    when `EmberENV.EXTEND_PROTOTYPES` or `EmberENV.EXTEND_PROTOTYPES.Function` is

    You can observe property changes simply by adding the `observes`
    call to the end of your method declarations in classes that you write.
    For example:

  description: |-
    The collection of functions, keyed by name, available on this
    `ActionHandler` as action targets.

    These functions will be invoked when a matching `{{action}}` is triggered
    from within a template and the application's current route is this route.

    Actions can also be invoked from other parts of your application
    via `ActionHandler#send`.

    The `actions` hash will inherit action handlers from
    the `actions` hash defined on extended parent classes
    or mixins rather than just replace the entire hash, e.g.:

    ```js
    App.CanDisplayBanner = Ember.Mixin.create({
      actions: {
        displayBanner(msg) {
          // ...
        }
      }
    });

    App.WelcomeRoute = Ember.Route.extend(App.CanDisplayBanner, {
      actions: {
        playMusic() {
          // ...
        }
      }
    });

    // `WelcomeRoute`, when active, will be able to respond
    // to both actions, since the actions hash is merged rather
    // then replaced when extending mixins / parent classes.
    this.send('displayBanner');
    this.send('playMusic');
    ```

    Within a Controller, Route or Component's action handler,
    the value of the `this` context is the Controller, Route or
    Component object:

    ```js
    App.SongRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
      actions: {
        myAction() {
          this.controllerFor("song");
          this.transitionTo("other.route");
          ...
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    It is also possible to call `this._super(...arguments)` from within an
    action handler if it overrides a handler defined on a parent
    class or mixin:

    Take for example the following routes:

    ```js
    App.DebugRoute = Ember.Mixin.create({
      actions: {
        debugRouteInformation() {
          console.debug("trololo");
        }
      }
    });

    App.AnnoyingDebugRoute = Ember.Route.extend(App.DebugRoute, {
      actions: {
        debugRouteInformation() {
          // also call the debugRouteInformation of mixed in App.DebugRoute
          this._super(...arguments);

          // show additional annoyance
          window.alert(...);
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    ## Bubbling

    By default, an action will stop bubbling once a handler defined
    on the `actions` hash handles it. To continue bubbling the action,
    you must return `true` from the handler:

    ```js
    App.Router.map(function() {
      this.route("album", function() {
        this.route("song");
      });
    });

    App.AlbumRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
      actions: {
        startPlaying: function() {
        }
      }
    });

    App.AlbumSongRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
      actions: {
        startPlaying() {
          // ...

          if (actionShouldAlsoBeTriggeredOnParentRoute) {
            return true;
          }
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    Returns the object at the given `index`. If the given `index` is negative
    or is greater or equal than the array length, returns `undefined`.

    This is one of the primitives you must implement to support `Ember.Array`.
    If your object supports retrieving the value of an array item using `get()`
    (i.e. `myArray.get(0)`), then you do not need to implement this method
    yourself.

    ```javascript
    let arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];

    arr.objectAt(0);   // 'a'
    arr.objectAt(3);   // 'd'

    normally must implement two methods:

    * `arrayDidChange(observedObj, start, removeCount, addCount)` - This method will be
      called just after the array is modified.

    Both callbacks will be passed the observed object, starting index of the

    Implement this method to make your class enumerable.

    This method will be called repeatedly during enumeration. The index value
    will always begin with 0 and increment monotonically. You don't have to
    rely on the index value to determine what object to return, but you should
    always check the value and start from the beginning when you see the
    requested index is 0.

    The `previousObject` is the object that was returned from the last call
    to `nextObject` for the current iteration. This is a useful way to
    manage iteration if you are tracing a linked list, for example.

    Finally the context parameter will always contain a hash you can use as
    a "scratchpad" to maintain any other state you need in order to iterate
    properly. The context object is reused and is not reset between
    iterations so make sure you setup the context with a fresh state whenever
    the index parameter is 0.

    Generally iterators will continue to call `nextObject` until the index
    reaches the current length-1. If you run out of data before this
    time for some reason, you should simply return undefined.

    The default implementation of this method simply looks up the index.
    This works great on any Array-like objects.

    item. This method corresponds to the `forEach()` method defined in
    JavaScript 1.6.

    The callback method you provide should have the following signature (all
    parameters are optional):

    ```javascript
    function(item, index, enumerable);
    ```

    - `item` is the current item in the iteration.
    - `index` is the current index in the iteration.
    - `enumerable` is the enumerable object itself.

    Note that in addition to a callback, you can also pass an optional target
    object that will be set as `this` on the context. This is a good way
    to give your iterator function access to the current object.

    This will combine the values of the enumerator into a single value. It

    The callback method you provide should have the following signature (all

    ```javascript

    - `previousValue` is the value returned by the last call to the iterator.
    - `item` is the current item in the iteration.
    - `index` is the current index in the iteration.

    Return the new cumulative value.

    In addition to the callback you can also pass an `initialValue`. An error
    will be raised if you do not pass an initial value and the enumerator is
    empty.

    Note that unlike the other methods, this method does not allow you to

    Retrieves the value of a property from the object.

    This method is usually similar to using `object[keyName]` or `object.keyName`,
    however it supports both computed properties and the unknownProperty
    handler.

    Because `get` unifies the syntax for accessing all these kinds
    of properties, it can make many refactorings easier, such as replacing a
    simple property with a computed property, or vice versa.

    ### Computed Properties

    Computed properties are methods defined with the `property` modifier
    declared at the end, such as:

    ```javascript
    fullName: Ember.computed('firstName', 'lastName', function() {
      return this.get('firstName') + ' ' + this.get('lastName');
    })
    ```

    When you call `get` on a computed property, the function will be
    called and the return value will be returned instead of the function
    itself.

    ### Unknown Properties

    Likewise, if you try to call `get` on a property whose value is
    `undefined`, the `unknownProperty()` method will be called on the object.
    If this method returns any value other than `undefined`, it will be returned
    instead. This allows you to implement "virtual" properties that are
    not defined upfront.
  itemtype: method
  name: get
  params:
  - name: keyName

    type: String
  return:
    description: The property value or undefined.

    To get the values of multiple properties at once, call `getProperties`
    with a list of strings or an array:

    ```javascript
    record.getProperties('firstName', 'lastName', 'zipCode');
    // { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', zipCode: '10011' }
    ```

    is equivalent to:

    ```javascript
    record.getProperties(['firstName', 'lastName', 'zipCode']);
    // { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', zipCode: '10011' }
    ```

  description: |-
    Sets the provided key or path to the value.

    ```javascript
    record.set("key", value);
    ```

    This method is generally very similar to calling `object["key"] = value` or
    `object.key = value`, except that it provides support for computed
    properties, the `setUnknownProperty()` method and property observers.

    ### Computed Properties

    If you try to set a value on a key that has a computed property handler
    defined (see the `get()` method for an example), then `set()` will call
    that method, passing both the value and key instead of simply changing
    the value itself. This is useful for those times when you need to
    implement a property that is composed of one or more member
    properties.

    ### Unknown Properties

    If you try to set a value on a key that is undefined in the target
    object, then the `setUnknownProperty()` handler will be called instead. This
    gives you an opportunity to implement complex "virtual" properties that
    are not predefined on the object. If `setUnknownProperty()` returns
    undefined, then `set()` will simply set the value on the object.

    ### Property Observers

    In addition to changing the property, `set()` will also register a property
    change with the object. Unless you have placed this call inside of a
    `beginPropertyChanges()` and `endPropertyChanges(),` any "local" observers
    (i.e. observer methods declared on the same object), will be called
    immediately. Any "remote" observers (i.e. observer methods declared on
    another object) will be placed in a queue and called at a later time in a
    coalesced manner.

    Notify the observer system that a property is about to change.

    Sometimes you need to change a value directly or indirectly without
    actually calling `get()` or `set()` on it. In this case, you can use this
    method and `propertyDidChange()` instead. Calling these two methods
    together will notify all observers that the property has potentially
    changed value.

    Note that you must always call `propertyWillChange` and `propertyDidChange`
    as a pair. If you do not, it may get the property change groups out of
    order and cause notifications to be delivered more often than you would
    like.

    Adds an observer on a property.

    This is the core method used to register an observer for a property.

    Once you call this method, any time the key's value is set, your observer
    will be notified. Note that the observers are triggered any time the
    value is set, regardless of whether it has actually changed. Your
    observer should be prepared to handle that.

    You can also pass an optional context parameter to this method. The
    context will be passed to your observer method whenever it is triggered.
    Note that if you add the same target/method pair on a key multiple times
    with different context parameters, your observer will only be called once
    with the last context you passed.

    ### Observer Methods

    Observer methods you pass should generally have the following signature if
    you do not pass a `context` parameter:

    ```javascript
    fooDidChange: function(sender, key, value, rev) { };
    ```

    The sender is the object that changed. The key is the property that
    changes. The value property is currently reserved and unused. The rev
    is the last property revision of the object when it changed, which you can
    use to detect if the key value has really changed or not.

    If you pass a `context` parameter, the context will be passed before the
    revision like so:

    ```javascript
    fooDidChange: function(sender, key, value, context, rev) { };
    ```

    Usually you will not need the value, context or revision parameters at
    the end. In this case, it is common to write observer methods that take
    only a sender and key value as parameters or, if you aren't interested in
    any of these values, to write an observer that has no parameters at all.

    Registers a factory that can be used for dependency injection (with
    `inject`) or for service lookup. Each factory is registered with
    a full name including two parts: `type:name`.

    A simple example:

    ```javascript
    let App = Ember.Application.create();

    App.Orange = Ember.Object.extend();
    App.register('fruit:favorite', App.Orange);
    ```

    Ember will resolve factories from the `App` namespace automatically.
    For example `App.CarsController` will be discovered and returned if
    an application requests `controller:cars`.

    An example of registering a controller with a non-standard name:

    ```javascript
    let App = Ember.Application.create();
    let Session = Ember.Controller.extend();

    App.register('controller:session', Session);

    // The Session controller can now be treated like a normal controller,
    // despite its non-standard name.
    App.ApplicationController = Ember.Controller.extend({
      needs: ['session']
    });
    ```

    Registered factories are **instantiated** by having `create`
    called on them. Additionally they are **singletons**, each time
    they are looked up they return the same instance.

    Some examples modifying that default behavior:

    ```javascript
    let App = Ember.Application.create();

    App.Person = Ember.Object.extend();
    App.Orange = Ember.Object.extend();
    App.Email = Ember.Object.extend();
    App.session = Ember.Object.create();

    App.register('model:user', App.Person, { singleton: false });
    App.register('fruit:favorite', App.Orange);
    App.register('communication:main', App.Email, { singleton: false });
    App.register('session', App.session, { instantiate: false });
    ```

    Define a dependency injection onto a specific factory or all factories
    of a type.

    When Ember instantiates a controller, view, or other framework component
    it can attach a dependency to that component. This is often used to
    provide services to a set of framework components.

    An example of providing a session object to all controllers:

    ```javascript
    let App = Ember.Application.create();
    let Session = Ember.Object.extend({ isAuthenticated: false });

    // A factory must be registered before it can be injected
    App.register('session:main', Session);

    // Inject 'session:main' onto all factories of the type 'controller'
    // with the name 'session'
    App.inject('controller', 'session', 'session:main');

    App.IndexController = Ember.Controller.extend({
      isLoggedIn: Ember.computed.alias('session.isAuthenticated')
    });
    ```

    Injections can also be performed on specific factories.

    ```javascript
    App.inject(<full_name or type>, <property name>, <full_name>)
    App.inject('route', 'source', 'source:main')
    App.inject('route:application', 'email', 'model:email')
    ```

    It is important to note that injections can only be performed on
    classes that are instantiated by Ember itself. Instantiating a class
    directly (via `create` or `new`) bypasses the dependency injection
    system.

    **Note:** Ember-Data instantiates its models in a unique manner, and consequently
    injections onto models (or all models) will not work as expected. Injections
    on models can be enabled by setting `EmberENV.MODEL_FACTORY_INJECTIONS`
    to `true`.

    Send an `action` with an `actionContext` to a `target`. The action, actionContext
    and target will be retrieved from properties of the object. For example:

    ```javascript
    App.SaveButtonView = Ember.View.extend(Ember.TargetActionSupport, {
      target: Ember.computed.alias('controller'),
      action: 'save',
      actionContext: Ember.computed.alias('context'),
      click() {
        this.triggerAction(); // Sends the `save` action, along with the current context
                              // to the current controller
      }
    });
    ```

    The `target`, `action`, and `actionContext` can be provided as properties of
    an optional object argument to `triggerAction` as well.

    ```javascript
    App.SaveButtonView = Ember.View.extend(Ember.TargetActionSupport, {
      click() {
        this.triggerAction({
          action: 'save',
          target: this.get('controller'),
          actionContext: this.get('context')
        }); // Sends the `save` action, along with the current context
            // to the current controller
      }
    });
    ```

    The `actionContext` defaults to the object you are mixing `TargetActionSupport` into.
    But `target` and `action` must be specified either as properties or with the argument
    to `triggerAction`, or a combination:

    ```javascript
    App.SaveButtonView = Ember.View.extend(Ember.TargetActionSupport, {

    An overridable method called when objects are instantiated. By default,
    does nothing unless it is overridden during class definition.

    Example:

    ```javascript
    const Person = Ember.Object.extend({
      init() {
        alert(`Name is ${this.get('name')}`);
      }
    });

    let steve = Person.create({
      name: "Steve"
    });

    // alerts 'Name is Steve'.
    ```

    NOTE: If you do override `init` for a framework class like `Ember.View`,
    be sure to call `this._super(...arguments)` in your
    `init` declaration! If you don't, Ember may not have an opportunity to
    do important setup work, and you'll see strange behavior in your
    application.

    Defines the properties that will be concatenated from the superclass
    (instead of overridden).

    By default, when you extend an Ember class a property defined in
    the subclass overrides a property with the same name that is defined
    in the superclass. However, there are some cases where it is preferable
    to build up a property's value by combining the superclass' property
    value with the subclass' value. An example of this in use within Ember
    is the `classNames` property of `Ember.View`.

    Here is some sample code showing the difference between a concatenated
    property and a normal one:

    ```javascript
    const Bar = Ember.Object.extend({
      // Configure which properties to concatenate
      concatenatedProperties: ['concatenatedProperty'],

      someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['bar'],
      concatenatedProperty: ['bar']
    });

    const FooBar = Bar.extend({
      someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['foo'],
      concatenatedProperty: ['foo']
    });

    let fooBar = FooBar.create();
    fooBar.get('someNonConcatenatedProperty'); // ['foo']
    fooBar.get('concatenatedProperty'); // ['bar', 'foo']
    ```

    This behavior extends to object creation as well. Continuing the
    above example:

    ```javascript
    let fooBar = FooBar.create({
      someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['baz'],
      concatenatedProperty: ['baz']
    })
    fooBar.get('someNonConcatenatedProperty'); // ['baz']
    fooBar.get('concatenatedProperty'); // ['bar', 'foo', 'baz']
    ```

    Adding a single property that is not an array will just add it in the array:

    ```javascript
    let fooBar = FooBar.create({
      concatenatedProperty: 'baz'
    })
    view.get('concatenatedProperty'); // ['bar', 'foo', 'baz']
    ```

    Using the `concatenatedProperties` property, we can tell Ember to mix the
    content of the properties.

    In `Ember.Component` the `classNames`, `classNameBindings` and
    `attributeBindings` properties are concatenated.

    This feature is available for you to use throughout the Ember object model,
    although typical app developers are likely to use it infrequently. Since
    it changes expectations about behavior of properties, you should properly
    document its usage in each individual concatenated property (to not
    mislead your users to think they can override the property in a subclass).

    Defines the properties that will be merged from the superclass
    (instead of overridden).

    By default, when you extend an Ember class a property defined in
    the subclass overrides a property with the same name that is defined
    in the superclass. However, there are some cases where it is preferable
    to build up a property's value by merging the superclass property value
    with the subclass property's value. An example of this in use within Ember
    is the `queryParams` property of routes.

    Here is some sample code showing the difference between a merged
    property and a normal one:

    ```javascript
    const Bar = Ember.Object.extend({
      // Configure which properties are to be merged
      mergedProperties: ['mergedProperty'],

      someNonMergedProperty: {
        nonMerged: 'superclass value of nonMerged'
      },
      mergedProperty: {
        page: {replace: false},
        limit: {replace: true}
      }
    });

    const FooBar = Bar.extend({
      someNonMergedProperty: {
        completelyNonMerged: 'subclass value of nonMerged'
      },
      mergedProperty: {
        limit: {replace: false}
      }
    });

    let fooBar = FooBar.create();

    fooBar.get('someNonMergedProperty');
    // => { completelyNonMerged: 'subclass value of nonMerged' }
    //
    // Note the entire object, including the nonMerged property of
    // the superclass object, has been replaced

    fooBar.get('mergedProperty');
    // => {
    //   page: {replace: false},
    //   limit: {replace: false}
    // }
    //
    // Note the page remains from the superclass, and the
    // `limit` property's value of `false` has been merged from
    // the subclass.
    ```

    This behavior is not available during object `create` calls. It is only
    available at `extend` time.

    In `Ember.Route` the `queryParams` property is merged.

    This feature is available for you to use throughout the Ember object model,
    although typical app developers are likely to use it infrequently. Since
    it changes expectations about behavior of properties, you should properly
    document its usage in each individual merged property (to not

    Returns a string representation which attempts to provide more information

    ```javascript
    const Person = Ember.Object.extend()
    person = Person.create()
    person.toString() //=> "<Person:ember1024>"
    ```

    If the object's class is not defined on an Ember namespace, it will

    const Student = Person.extend()
    let student = Student.create()
    student.toString() //=> "<(subclass of Person):ember1025>"

    Creates a new subclass.

    ```javascript
    const Person = Ember.Object.extend({
      say(thing) {
        alert(thing);
       }
    });
    ```

    This defines a new subclass of Ember.Object: `Person`. It contains one method: `say()`.

    You can also create a subclass from any existing class by calling its `extend()` method.
    For example, you might want to create a subclass of Ember's built-in `Ember.Component` class:

    ```javascript
    const PersonComponent = Ember.Component.extend({
      tagName: 'li',
      classNameBindings: ['isAdministrator']
    });
    ```

    When defining a subclass, you can override methods but still access the
    implementation of your parent class by calling the special `_super()` method:

    ```javascript
    const Person = Ember.Object.extend({
      say(thing) {
        var name = this.get('name');
        alert(`${name} says: ${thing}`);
      }
    });

    const Soldier = Person.extend({
      say(thing) {
        this._super(`${thing}, sir!`);
      },
      march(numberOfHours) {
        alert(`${this.get('name')} marches for ${numberOfHours} hours.`);
      }
    });

    let yehuda = Soldier.create({
      name: "Yehuda Katz"
    });

    yehuda.say("Yes");  // alerts "Yehuda Katz says: Yes, sir!"
    ```

    The `create()` on line #17 creates an *instance* of the `Soldier` class.
    The `extend()` on line #8 creates a *subclass* of `Person`. Any instance
    of the `Person` class will *not* have the `march()` method.

    You can also pass `Mixin` classes to add additional properties to the subclass.

    ```javascript
    const Person = Ember.Object.extend({
      say(thing) {
        alert(`${this.get('name')} says: ${thing}`);
      }
    });

    const SingingMixin = Mixin.create({
      sing(thing){
        alert(`${this.get('name')} sings: la la la ${thing}`);
      }
    });

    const BroadwayStar = Person.extend(SingingMixin, {
      dance() {
        alert(`${this.get('name')} dances: tap tap tap tap `);
      }
    });
    ```

    The `BroadwayStar` class contains three methods: `say()`, `sing()`, and `dance()`.

    `create` will call the `init` function if defined during
    `Ember.AnyObject.extend`

    If no arguments are passed to `create`, it will not set values to the new
    instance during initialization:

    ```javascript
    let noName = Person.create();
    noName.helloWorld(); // alerts undefined
    ```

    NOTE: For performance reasons, you cannot declare methods or computed

    properties when using `extend`.

    In some cases, you may want to annotate computed properties with additional
    metadata about how they function or what values they operate on. For
    example, computed property functions may close over variables that are then
    no longer available for introspection.

    You can pass a hash of these values to a computed property like this:

    ```javascript
    person: Ember.computed(function() {
      var personId = this.get('personId');
      return Person.create({ id: personId });
    }).meta({ type: Person })
    ```

    Once you've done this, you can retrieve the values saved to the computed
    property from your class like this:

    ```javascript
    MyClass.metaForProperty('person');
    ```

    This will return the original hash that was passed to `meta()`.

    Creates an `Ember.NativeArray` from an Array like object.
    Does not modify the original object. Ember.A is not needed if
    `EmberENV.EXTEND_PROTOTYPES` is `true` (the default value). However,
    it is recommended that you use Ember.A when creating addons for
    ember or when you can not guarantee that `EmberENV.EXTEND_PROTOTYPES`
    will be `true`.

    Example

    ```js
    export default Ember.Component.extend({
      tagName: 'ul',
      classNames: ['pagination'],

      init() {
        this._super(...arguments);

        if (!this.get('content')) {
          this.set('content', Ember.A());

      }
    });

    Creates a property that lazily looks up a service in the container. There
    are no restrictions as to what objects a service can be injected into.

    Example:

    ```javascript
    App.ApplicationRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
      authManager: Ember.inject.service('auth'),

      model: function() {
        return this.get('authManager').findCurrentUser();
      }
    });
    ```

    This example will create an `authManager` property on the application route
    that looks up the `auth` service in the container, making it easily
    accessible in the `model` hook.

    Apply formatting options to the string. This will look for occurrences
    of "%@" in your string and substitute them with the arguments you pass into
    this method. If you want to control the specific order of replacement,
    you can add a number after the key as well to indicate which argument
    you want to insert.

    Ordered insertions are most useful when building loc strings where values
    you need to insert may appear in different orders.

    ```javascript
    "Hello %@ %@".fmt('John', 'Doe');     // "Hello John Doe"

    Formats the passed string, but first looks up the string in the localized
    strings hash. This is a convenient way to localize text. See
    `Ember.String.fmt()` for more information on formatting.

    Note that it is traditional but not required to prefix localized string
    keys with an underscore or other character so you can easily identify
    localized strings.

    Compares two objects, returning true if they are equal.

    Ember.isEqual(1, 2);                               // false
    ```

    `isEqual` is a more specific comparison than a triple equal comparison.
    It will call the `isEqual` instance method on the objects being
    compared, allowing finer control over when objects should be considered
    equal to each other.

    ```javascript
    let Person = Ember.Object.extend({
      isEqual(other) { return this.ssn == other.ssn; }
    });

    let personA = Person.create({name: 'Muhammad Ali', ssn: '123-45-6789'});
    let personB = Person.create({name: 'Cassius Clay', ssn: '123-45-6789'});

    Ember.isEqual(personA, personB); // true
    ```

    Due to the expense of array comparisons, collections will never be equal to
    each other even if each of their items are equal to each other.

    Ember.isEqual([4, 2], [4, 2]);                     // false

    This hook defers the readiness of the application, so that you can start
    the app when your tests are ready to run. It also sets the router's
    location to 'none', so that the window's location will not be modified
    (preventing both accidental leaking of state between tests and interference
    with your testing framework).

    ```
    App.setupForTesting();

    This injects the test helpers into the `helperContainer` object. If an object is provided
    it will be used as the helperContainer. If `helperContainer` is not set it will default
    to `window`. If a function of the same name has already been defined it will be cached
    (so that it can be reset if the helper is removed with `unregisterHelper` or
    `removeTestHelpers`).

    Any callbacks registered with `onInjectHelpers` will be called once the

    Causes the run loop to process any pending events. This is used to ensure that
    any async operations from other helpers (or your assertions) have been processed.

    This is most often used as the return value for the helper functions (see 'click',
    'fillIn','visit',etc). However, there is a method to register a test helper which
    utilizes this method without the need to actually call `wait()` in your helpers.

    The `wait` helper is built into `registerAsyncHelper` by default. You will not need
    to `return app.testHelpers.wait();` - the wait behavior is provided for you.

    Example:

    ```javascript
    Ember.Test.registerAsyncHelper('loginUser', function(app, username, password) {
      visit('secured/path/here')
        .fillIn('#username', username)

    `registerHelper` is used to register a test helper that will be injected
    when `App.injectTestHelpers` is called.

    The helper method will always be called with the current Application as
    the first parameter.

    For example:

    ```javascript
    Ember.Test.registerHelper('boot', function(app) {
      Ember.run(app, app.advanceReadiness);
    });
    ```

    This helper can later be called without arguments because it will be
    called with `app` as the first parameter.

    App.injectTestHelpers();
    boot();

    `registerAsyncHelper` is used to register an async test helper that will be injected

    The advantage of an async helper is that it will not run
    until the last async helper has completed.  All async helpers
    after it will wait for it complete before running.


    For example:

    ```javascript
    Ember.Test.registerAsyncHelper('deletePost', function(app, postId) {
      click('.delete-' + postId);
    });

    This allows ember-testing to play nicely with other asynchronous
    events, such as an application that is waiting for a CSS3
    transition or an IndexDB transaction. The waiter runs periodically
    after each async helper (i.e. `click`, `andThen`, `visit`, etc) has executed,
    until the returning result is truthy. After the waiters finish, the next async helper
    is executed and the process repeats.

    For example:

    ```javascript
    Ember.Test.registerWaiter(function() {
      return myPendingTransactions() == 0;
    });
    ```
    The `context` argument allows you to optionally specify the `this`
    with which your callback will be invoked.

    Strongly hint runtimes to intern the provided string.

    When do I need to use this function?

    For the most part, never. Pre-mature optimization is bad, and often the
    runtime does exactly what you need it to, and more often the trade-off isn't
    worth it.

    Why?

    Runtimes store strings in at least 2 different representations:
    Ropes and Symbols (interned strings). The Rope provides a memory efficient
    data-structure for strings created from concatenation or some other string
    manipulation like splitting.

    Unfortunately checking equality of different ropes can be quite costly as
    runtimes must resort to clever string comparison algorithms. These
    algorithms typically cost in proportion to the length of the string.
    Luckily, this is where the Symbols (interned strings) shine. As Symbols are
    unique by their string content, equality checks can be done by pointer
    comparison.

    How do I know if my string is a rope or symbol?

    Typically (warning general sweeping statement, but truthy in runtimes at
    present) static strings created as part of the JS source are interned.
    Strings often used for comparisons can be interned at runtime if some
    criteria are met.  One of these criteria can be the size of the entire rope.
    For example, in chrome 38 a rope longer then 12 characters will not
    intern, nor will segments of that rope.

    Framework objects in an Ember application (components, services, routes, etc.)
    are created via a factory and dependency injection system. Each of these
    objects is the responsibility of an "owner", which handled its
    instantiation and manages its lifetime.

    `getOwner` fetches the owner object responsible for an instance. This can
    be used to lookup or resolve other class instances, or register new factories
    into the owner.

    For example, this component dynamically looks up a service based on the
    `audioType` passed as an attribute:

    ```
    // app/components/play-audio.js
    import Ember from 'ember';

    // Usage:
    //
    //   {{play-audio audioType=model.audioType audioFile=model.file}}

        return owner.lookup(`service:${this.get('audioType')}`);

      click() {

    Calls an action passed to a component.

    For example a component for playing or pausing music may translate click events
    into action notifications of "play" or "stop" depending on some internal state
    of the component:

    ```javascript
    // app/components/play-button.js
    export default Ember.Component.extend({
      click() {
        if (this.get('isPlaying')) {
          this.sendAction('play');
        } else {
          this.sendAction('stop');
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    The actions "play" and "stop" must be passed to this `play-button` component:

    ```handlebars
    {{! app/templates/application.hbs }}
    {{play-button play=(action "musicStarted") stop=(action "musicStopped")}}
    ```

    When the component receives a browser `click` event it translate this
    interaction into application-specific semantics ("play" or "stop") and
    calls the specified action.

    ```javascript
    // app/controller/application.js
    export default Ember.Controller.extend({
      actions: {
        musicStarted() {
          // called when the play button is clicked
          // and the music started playing
        },
        musicStopped() {
          // called when the play button is clicked
          // and the music stopped playing
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    If no action is passed to `sendAction` a default name of "action"
    is assumed.

    ```javascript
    // app/components/next-button.js
    export default Ember.Component.extend({
      click() {
        this.sendAction();
      }
    });
    ```

    ```handlebars
    {{! app/templates/application.hbs }}
    {{next-button action=(action "playNextSongInAlbum")}}
    ```

    ```javascript
    // app/controllers/application.js
    App.ApplicationController = Ember.Controller.extend({
      actions: {
        playNextSongInAlbum() {

    Creates a new DOM element, renders the view into it, then returns the
    element.

    By default, the element created and rendered into will be a `BODY` element,
    since this is the default context that views are rendered into when being
    inserted directly into the DOM.

    ```js
    let element = view.renderToElement();
    element.tagName; // => "BODY"
    ```

    You can override the kind of element rendered into and returned by
    specifying an optional tag name as the first argument.

    ```js
    let element = view.renderToElement('table');
    element.tagName; // => "TABLE"
    ```

    This method is useful if you want to render the view into an element that
    is not in the document's body. Instead, a new `body` element, detached from
    the DOM is returned. FastBoot uses this to serialize the rendered view into
    a string for transmission over the network.

    ```js
    app.visit('/').then(function(instance) {
      let element;
      Ember.run(function() {
        element = renderToElement(instance);
      });

      res.send(serialize(element));
    });

    Strongly hint runtimes to intern the provided string.

    When do I need to use this function?

    For the most part, never. Pre-mature optimization is bad, and often the
    runtime does exactly what you need it to, and more often the trade-off isn't
    worth it.

    Why?

    Runtimes store strings in at least 2 different representations:
    Ropes and Symbols (interned strings). The Rope provides a memory efficient
    data-structure for strings created from concatenation or some other string
    manipulation like splitting.

    Unfortunately checking equality of different ropes can be quite costly as
    runtimes must resort to clever string comparison algorithms. These
    algorithms typically cost in proportion to the length of the string.
    Luckily, this is where the Symbols (interned strings) shine. As Symbols are
    unique by their string content, equality checks can be done by pointer
    comparison.

    How do I know if my string is a rope or symbol?

    Typically (warning general sweeping statement, but truthy in runtimes at
    present) static strings created as part of the JS source are interned.
    Strings often used for comparisons can be interned at runtime if some
    criteria are met.  One of these criteria can be the size of the entire rope.
    For example, in chrome 38 a rope longer then 12 characters will not
    intern, nor will segments of that rope.
