<h2>The Ember Logo</h2>

<p>
  The Ember logo is an official project resource that can be used on websites, mobile apps, or in printed materials&mdash;assuming no connotation of official status or project/core team endorsement. It may not be manipulated in any way, and is best displayed on a black or very light colored background. The ® symbol must be present.
</p>

<p>
  The Ember project has numerous projects under the Ember umbrella. These other logos may be used under the same terms as the primary Ember logo.
