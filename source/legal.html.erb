<h3>Non-Legalese TL;DR</h3>

<p>
	Ember's strong brand and identity are an important part of the project. We're protective of it! Please be respectful and <a href="mailto:leah@emberjs.com">reach out</a> if you're unsure if your use is acceptable. Visit <a href="/logos">the Logos page</a> to learn more about what is and isn't permitted, and to download logos.
</p>
<p>
	We often grant licenses for use of the Ember logo for non-commercial community use cases. If you think you might be one of them, let's talk. We always aim to be reasonable.
</p>
<p>
  The Tomster in particular has many more restrictions and should not be used without express authorization. <a href="../tomster">You can view the various official Tomsters</a>, and check out <a href="../tomster/faq">our growing FAQ</a>.
