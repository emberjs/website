However, over the years, Ember became a hindrance. We desperately needed better performance, we needed a more flexible build system, we needed the ability to server-side render. I also grew to realize that the Ember community is closed off from the larger JS community. Requiring an Ember addon for consuming a standard ES6 library and focusing on Ember-specific libraries means there is less sharing, and more focus on Ember-only solutions. And, to be completly honest, tools like webpack have far out paced Ember-cli and broccoli.

Ember-CLI, on the other hand, could really use some work. Its scope is way beyond what it should be (e.g. ember install in place of npm/yarn), its underlying build system (Broccoli) is horrible on Windows (and the ""trees"" model is awkward to write plugins for compared to, say, flyjs), its environment confuses build-time env with runtime env making it tricky to work with 12factor-app-style ENV variables. While I want to show Ember to everyone, Ember CLI tends to counter the elegance of it. I think it just needs more assertive leadership, saying ""no"" more often to prevent feature creep. To end on a positive note, using esnext has been a wonderful experience, so great decision on embracing that early on. Thanks to all the hard work from Ember teams. It had a long journey being one of the first frameworks to successfully embrace SPAs properly. It's been a battle, and the hard work doesn't go unrecognized.

I have full confidence in the core team and the community to continue their superb work on the framework. However, as a full stack js developer, I'd love to see how the excellent minds of the Ember core team could help solve some of the pain points with building JSON API compliant APIs. I feel my front end coding and deployment experience is amazing. Yet building a solid, JSON API compliant API in my language of choice (js) and then deploying it is very messy and frustrating. There's a promising young framework with a similar 'convention over configuration' mantra called Lux (https://github.com/postlight/lux), which feels like an elegant solution. However, I think it could be very valuable for Ember to consider how we, as a community, can come up with a unified solution to own a monopoly on the development experience of the whole stack.",3/1/2017 8:46,3/1/2017 9:48,c9509dc2cd

Lacks of needed features where they're supposed to be.
Outdated paradigms.
Facts:
- mess with templates/controllers/routes/components. Still no routable components, controllers not deprecated, routes still can't have the same actions (out of the box) as controller has, no pod structure out of the box;
- ember-data tries to be smart and do the magic like ActiveRecord, but feels like unfinished product instead. For instance, why it doesn't have FormData support? For files uploading, at least. Why it doesn't have a method for custom wrapped authorized requests?
- thanks for killing bower dependency, really. Hope to see yarn support in nearest future or at least out of the box importing of npm modules into the ember-cli-build;

As a consumer of Ember, and as a person trying to evangelize its use to the rest of my company, it's getting harder to answer questions about ""how/when is Ember going to modernize feature X"". For instance, ""why can't I use ES6 classes in Ember? What is this Broccoli thing? Why don't they use Webpack?""

I freaking love Ember, and its community, and I feel like it's getting harder and harder for me to convince newcomers who were told ""React is everything"" to even give Ember a try because I can't answer a lot of the questions about where and when Ember is going to modernize many of its more ""crufty"" aspects.",3/1/2017 15:24,3/1/2017 15:36,cad7714e1b

1bd88ce131a86cc31335a33dbc059f53,7,I worked for long term Ember project and I survived migration from 1.11 to 2.0 but I noticed that learning curve for a new team member may be a quite long and painful. There are too many abstractions and new people in project with pure JS experience are mostly confused. The ember-cli is nice tool but for big project with pods the compile time was quite long when we compare similar size project with React and webpack. Moreover I noticed that Ember's release cycle has some disadvantage - too many breaking changes in short period of time (yeap there are lts but previously it was quite hell). When you are working for MVP and you are going to invest time to a new features rather than make tweaks for deprecations.

Provide a coherent (and preferably beautiful) roadmap of which RFCs will be worked on and when, including any dependencies on prior RFC's. This doesn't need to be a commitment to a deadline, but it should accurately reflect the order in which things need to be accomplished.

2. RFC mentorship. If someone is thinking of submitting an RFC for the first time, they should have mentorship from either someone on the core team, or someone who has successfully shepherded one or more RFCs through to acceptance. This will encourage more community engagement with the entire RFC process. More people will be willing to give it a try themselves, which increases the number of people who can help people, decreasing load on the center.

3. Commitment to real and meaningful improvements to the core handlebars developer experience. Handlebars is fantastic, and has _huge_ potential as a pure reactive FP environment, but angle bracket syntax and performance do not represent real progress. There needs to be a communal acknowledgement that JSX as a programming model is currently an order of magnitude simpler to grok and an order of magnitude more powerful. We have to get over the denial phase, acknowledge the gap, and close it.",3/1/2017 15:37,3/1/2017 16:09,c84f55edcd

Ember's dedication to backwards compatibility and stability is outstanding, however feature development and implementation seem extremely slow. Angular shot themselves in the foot with Angular2, and React is taking over everything.

Ember feels a bit stuck to me, with Controllers being more less deprecated, but still being forced to use them, and while the HBS syntax for conditionals and loops are fine, components are moving to angle-bracket syntax on almost all other front-end frame, and Ember needs to keep up with that",3/1/2017 19:06,3/1/2017 19:31,28c1a8dd41

(Though this is probably a case of me caring more about the artifacts than the kick-ass mobile performance the team is working toward).

After reading the spec for the new folder layout, I'm afraid it's simpler for people who are writing add-ons and using engines, but much more complicated if you aren't, which I would guess is the majority of Ember developers).

A better learning curve, a way to achieve this could be to gather a best practice of doing things with Ember. A couple of years ago, I think there was many ways for writing a specific feature because at that time Ember provided more tools than now (like view, controller, component, route, resource, also more directives in the templates). Now many parts were simplified and I love this transition because newbies don't have to learn many things. For example, Python community has a principle saying ""There must be only one way to solve a problem."". I wish something like this for Ember.

I think the openness is great and enables a lot of people to contribute. In my opinion it is important that big companies like LinkedIn are not getting too strong and backup the whole community. This would lead to dependence on one big player like it is in other frameworks (Angular-->Google, React-->Facebook).
Also I think we as a community have to be more active and express the advantages of the Ember project more clearly. Maybe we should do more evangelism. Ember is a great project but it does not get enough attention and disappears not only behind the big two players (Angular, React) but also behind smaller projects like vue.js or all the React variants like preact, inferno etc.

Technically: I think static typing is a big deal. This would open a whole new area for improvements for example in developer tools/ergonomics or optimizations (for compiler, build tools etc). Furthermore a smaller bundle size (vendor.js and app.js) would be great. From the performance point I think Ember is quite competitive but better performance is always great :-) so the Ember project should not rest and should still improve performance. 

Maybe some ""crazy"" prototypes or experiments could lead to technical improvement and getting better visibility in the JS framework market. Some things I could think of: experiments with WebAssembly, bringing certain parts of the framework (or ember-data) into webworkers. I think prove of concepts are enough in this area but I could be seen as some kind of developer marketing :-)",3/2/2017 7:57,3/2/2017 8:25,fd08fc2136

e7bdd927eceb848f21396bfe44245c76,8,"If Ember is a candidate for your project, your most obvious alternatives are React+Redux, Angular, and Vue.
* Vue is compelling to me because of its more modular nature and parity with web standards, but the template code is not as aesthetically pleasing or intuitive as handlebars
* React is ergonomic and can be productive, but  I think they are actively undermining the open web standards community, and the ecosystem is the wild west - it's not suitable for a large project being worked on by many people, where robust, clear code is preferable to cleverness, brevity, or experimentation.
* Angular is something I haven't toyed with very much, but at first blush it seems to have a really steep learning curve and doesn't offer compelling benefits over the over frameworks.
* Ember is fairly monolithic so there's a certain amount of complexity required of an application before Ember becomes the right choice. It's been around for awhile, so a good bit of cruft has built up. The community is very strong and actively collaborating on ways to improve it, so it remains a very strong contender, but it's most definitely not sexy and sleeker alternatives like Vue seem attractive.

I am regularly asked what framework existing devs should use on a big project, and my advice is always similar to ""Ember, for ember-data, ember-cli and acceptance testing. They save you so much effort compared to combining your own toolset, even though they're almost canceled out by writing your main ember.js app, which the core team is trying to make theoretically ideal like Haskell instead of practically efficient like Vue."" Canary-beta-release-LTS is a great way to build new features, but the fact that we're seeing big features take years of RFC discussion and complete perfection before rolling out all at once, makes me wish more of them could get out the door in levels. Fastboot and Engines look like great examples of that; maybe the other 2.0-planned features could roll out in the same way. Sorry for the rant, you all are great, but it might be time at EmberConf to tell the community we're going to have quicker deadlines, make a little more compromise, and get a nearly-correct version of Ember's wishlist done before 2019.",3/2/2017 16:28,3/2/2017 17:01,2780f539a9

(Every ember project I have worked on with a larger team has always had ember-data fall way behind in its supported version.  We currently have 2.10 ember in prod but only 2.2 of ember-data. I found this is because of 3 things: ember-data changing to much of its surface area, serializers can very easily get out of date / are not well tested, ember-data requires to much setup when most of the time we just want a slimmed down version like ember-cli-simple-store or even just ember.$.ajax).",3/2/2017 8:14,3/2/2017 20:30,8f931cedfd

Monitoring the responses on ember-cli issues I became increasingly concerned about the tone that was taken with others. For an example I recall an issue where someone asked if ember-cli might switch to Webpack to share more code with angular-cli since it is a fork of ember-cli. It isn't that I think is 100% the way to go but the treatment of the opener was quite rude. Also comments made around the switch to yarn. The tone was as if a developer would be stupid to want to still use NPM. This was months ago and for the record as of 2 weeks ago yarn did not install in node/alpine and it still won't install my privately scoped global packages correctly. Again this isn't to say yarn might not be the better option for some of the the tone of discourse over the last 6 months has made me very uneasy.,3/2/2017 22:34,3/2/2017 22:46,6108b1fcb4

I would especially like to see Engines be flexible enough to allow for components to be injected by the parent. I understand that it breaks the cores idea of isolation. But not every app needs to follow Engines or use Engines in that manner. I have one rather large project with multiple teams and the utilization of engines is more for organization that it is for scope isolation. So I can see a need.

OR

What if we had something that was similar to Engines but not Engines itself. Call it something different but allow for the concept I mentioned above. I know Im not the only one asking for this functionality. Like Ember Segments.

I hope they can bring back the feeling of writing normal javascript. I thought that was the most appealing part of React.  They don't have the use of `Ember.get` syntax which uses strings to access properties everywhere. This isn't typesafe, makes refactoring difficult, and goes against normal conventions.  It's also confusing when it's required or optional depending of it's proxying through some abstraction.

On the top of my head, when it comes to dynamically changing different parts of the layout(e.g. header/footer) based on the currently rendered template – then you're on your own!
You either have to come with a hacky implementation(something similar to Discourse's way), or to randomly stumble upon the elsewhere addon which:
a) Introduces other problems, for example, it does not solve the problem of loading models for such dynamic components(ending up loading models from the component!).

It doesn't feel like there's a core member or two really pushing stuff as it has earlier in ember's life. As a small example, Ember 2 was announced and didn't ship for almost a year after being announced. Glimmer didn't ship for 6 months. Fastboot featured prominently at last year's Emberconf but still hasn't shipped 1.0. To be clear, it's okay this stuff takes time. But the slowness makes the case for a lack of resources in the core team and further, a consistent pattern of announcing work far far far before it's done. Creating innaccurate expectations is an unforced error. When people think ember is slow shipping (routable components?), it's entirely the fault of the core team for not actively messaging accurate expectations.

7de4cd932b5f8be0157a005e2fede6a9,8,"I think Ember is a good choice based on its ability to progress with the ever changing landscape that is the Web. Its core infrastructure allows it to be nimble. Backwards compatibility is paramount between versions. Ember is also silently powering some of the largest code bases and many if not all of those companies are able to utilize current technology because of the good upgrade story.  Its a combination of  smaller modules or libraries if you will, that are configured and connected to turn it into a powerful framework hence the motto convention over configuration.

This is crucial in a company.

Furhermore, the opinionated way of doing things is super important for me.

For a company like mine where J2EE is still the rule, an opinionated framework that brings well-structured projects and best practices out of the box is crucial.

Honestly I am impressed by the quality of this framework. The community is super great and
I fully trust the Ember and Ember-CLI core teams to lead us to a bright future.

Aside from that, performance of components is the biggest issue for us given the size of our application (well over 100k lines). We're not going to be moving away from Ember anytime soon, but if I have the man power I'd seriously pursue it.

I like Ember, but I don't like having frameworks that are so opinionated about how things should be done. I also am starting to oppose Object Oriented languages as a whole. I've found Clojure (our server for instance) and Clojurescript to be infinitely simpler and more robust than languages heavily reliant upon mutable state. ",3/9/2017 13:27,3/9/2017 13:40,14018c0940

f02accd37acbf914978add2b628c65bb,5,"Ember is truly a Framework and has been around for a bit. Because it attempts to solve many problems holistically within a complex, rapidly changing problem space, Ember cannot easily adapt to changes and practices in the JS ecosystem at large. A few examples are:

1) Ember cannot easily integrate with the rest of the commonjs/es module ecosystem. packages require an AMD wrapper or Ember specific addons (ember-moment, etc)
2) Monolithic build: if you use Ember, you must import and ship all of Ember to your users. No dead code elimination, no code splitting, everything hung off the Ember namespace.
3) Awkwardness around the relationship between templates, controllers, routes, and components (ie routable components)
4) Ember.Object and custom class system instead of ""plain"" JS classes and APIs
5) Ember.Enumerable and prototype monkey patching vs delegating to a utility lib
6) Lack of strong conventions and architecture around DDAU: routes, controllers, and components can all implement actions to mutate state. State can live at multiple layers of the app: route, controller, component, or service.
7) The ember router couples nested URLs to nested UI. Sometimes when rendering '/posts/123/comments', I want to load comments data after posts, but I *do not* want to nest the comments UI within the posts template (via outlet). Wormhole hacks around this, but this is a design mistake, imo.
8) There is a mentality within the community to ""go with the herd"", folks are reluctant to implement solutions without them being blessed as ""The Ember Way"" by the core team or key members in the community.

It has a great community, growing ecosystem(cli, addons, twiddle), backed by strong abstractions and extremely professional team. The conventional approach has proven as a great way to reduce boilerplate and maintanance complexity. Testability++.
Ember constantly moves forward in its unique way. I believe it makes things right!

Anyways there are some cons like:
 - Right now there are few competitors which looks more self-selling(react, ng2, vue). Most of them are more popular at this moment.
 - Also there are several issues which Ember should resolve because most of competitors doesn't have such issues:
  - custom object model(inability to use typescript in an effective way)
  - build process(tree shaking)
  - routing. There is some incompleteness in router DSL(no optional params) and routing itself(redundant and inconsistent behavior of model hook when the whole model passed to link-to for route with dynamic param vs w/o param)
  - controllers.

I think popularity is not the most critical part for framework but being competetive in the info space is.

I believe one of the most obvious way to improve something here is to publish more articles by learning team on a regular base. Ideally leaning team could re-use it in official docs.",3/12/2017 20:16,3/12/2017 21:07,ab7975fae4

cf88015f582f1c9024fd94581e59bd2b,3,"I think Ember is too opinionated, too rigid, and tries to do too much. For example, to create reactive properties you have to use Ember.Object. To make computed properties you have to use Ember.computed. Whereas with a framework like Vue, property reactivity is handled for you without you defining properties as reactive explicitly, and computed properties are plain JavaScript functions. I don't like how Ember has to use its own build tool (Broccoli) instead of something more widely used and supported like Webpack or even Browserify.

I think controllers are an extremely confusing topic in Ember. They're discouraged yet almost required, and it's not quite clear what their functionality is supposed to be. It's taken a long time for routable components to be a thing, and there have been very few updates on the progress of them. I think this is a real stumbling block for people who are trying to learn Ember. They hear that Ember is an MVC framework but quickly find out that the C is crippled and sort of an outcast.

Size and speed are also very bad categories for Ember compared to other frameworks. I feel like the documentation could use some attention.

I think Ember can do better at marketing itself. Competing with Angular and React may not be the best way to win developer adoption. Ember is in a category of it's own that's actually closer to ExtJS. When Flex got shutdown, Sencha made a great effort to draw developers onto the Ext platform. Ember should make an effort to market to those developers that used to build apps on Flex and Sencha.",3/15/2017 21:37,3/15/2017 21:53,dc643f7166

I like the Ember project very much, I use it every day I'm working. Debugging is sometimes a pain because it does not show where the error comes from in the app code. It goes to some Ember code which I have no idea where is got triggered. This makes upgrading the apps we have a pain. I know the effort you guys put in this upgrading pain, so thanks for that.

What I can comment on is that it seems like among my friends and contacts in the web dev community, for better or worse, Ember is seen like an also-ran in the ""battle"" between Angular and React, which in turn makes it difficult for my employer to find devs who want to work on Ember projects, and our local meetups have been getting a bit smaller of late.

In projects where the codebase is sure to grow, Ember enforces best practices that allow new team members to be productive quickly and experienced developers to write code others can understand and maintain.

Furthermore, by embracing an open governance and contribution model where any organization can have influence Ember allows adopting companies to reduce risk that a key part of their infrastructure will change direction away from their own needs, or that it will not adapt to their changing needs at all.

0301948986618a0992694d968b86d2e1,3,"I started using and championing Ember because of the core team's focus building a framework useful for app developers as opposed to just beautiful framework design. Is this still a goal for the core team? There is such a vacuum about the state of ember, the framework goals and the timeline for things. Engines and FastBoot are looking great and have gotten a lot of attention, but those features benefit primarily larger ember users. Glimmer 2 is also looking great, and it does benefit us all, but it's taken so much time and at this point it does not bring any new features beyond performance.

Features like routable components, enhanced pods, routing service, and test unification are foundational improvements that benefit all of us. Beyond RFCs and old PRs, those features seem to be mostly stuck.  I worry things have gotten so big and so complex that it's hard for the devs with only a few hours of availability to contribute. Additionally, with the bigger efforts like Glimmer 2 and Engines underway for months, I've sensed an unwillingness to take on medium and smaller features until the larger ones had completed. I definitely understand where that comes from, but somehow we users have to work past that.

The amount of time that's gone into building larger features has me really worried for the future. Competing frameworks have done a much better job at iterating core parts of their API over the past 2 years, while ember has mostly focused on the edges. If you compare the framework changes from Ember-1.0 thru Ember-1.10 to Ember-2.0 thru Ember-2.10 it's night and day.",,Code and examples,,discuss.emberjs.com,,Ember Core Notes Repo,,,Ember RFC's,,,,Local meetups,,,,,,,,2–3 years,Advanced,Advanced,"JavaScript Modules (import, export, etc.)",,,,,Writing basic tests,,,,Fastboot & server-side rendering,,,,,,Routing & the Router,Promises,,,All the time,My employer was already using Ember,Important,Software Developer / Engineer,,,,,,,,Employee working on product(s),,,,,,,,,Emacs,,,,,,WebStorm / IntelliJ / Other Jetbrains,,,,,,,,,,,None of these,,Mac OS,,,,Angular 1.x,,,,,,,,,,React,,,,,,101–500,11–20,The same amount,No requirements,1,,,,,,,,,,,,Technology,,,,,,,1.13,,2.1,,,2.4 LTS,,,,2.8 LTS,,,,2.12,,,,,"Release (stable release, e.g. 2.11.0)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I don't know,,,,,,,,,,,,I don't know,"Broccoli, without Ember-CLI",Ember-CLI,Ember-CLI-Rails,,,Webpack,,,,,,,,,,,,Ruby,,,,,,,,,,Grape (Ruby),,,,,Phoenix (Elixir),,Rails (Ruby),,,,,,,,,,,,,JSON-API,,"A non-standards based library (such as ActiveModelSerializers 0.8, etc.)",Custom design,,,,,,, Ember-QUnit (Ember-CLI default),Jasmine,,,Selenium (Cucumber),,,,,,6–9 months,,,1.5–2 years,2+ years,,Daily,Every few days,,,,,,,,,Capistrano,Chef,,,,Docker,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Desktop & mobile (fully responsive),,,,,,,,The general public (B2C),Business consumers (B2B),,Mobile browsers,"Modern browsers (last two versions, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.)",,IE 11,IE 10,,,,Mobile browsers,"Modern browsers (last two versions, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.)",,IE 11,,,,,,,,,An app that is used by millions of users,"Amazon Web Services (AWS, such as S3, ElasticBeanstalk, Lambda)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Gitlab CE (self-hosted),,,,,,,,In a shared repository with the API code,,,,,,,"My apps are indexable, but I don't know how",,,4–6,0,Unit tests,Integration tests,,,,,1.13,,2.1,,2.3,2.4 LTS,,,,2.8 LTS,,,,,,,,,Mobile browsers,"Modern browsers (last two versions, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.)",,IE 11,,,,,,,,,North America,,,,"College degree, computer science",,,3/21/2017 18:49,3/21/2017 19:01,7fe715cadb
