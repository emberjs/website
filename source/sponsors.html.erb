<h1>
  Ember Sponsors and Friends
</h1>

<p>
  It's still early in the life of the project, but we couldn't have gotten as far as we have without the support&mdash;both financial and technical&mdash;of the following companies:
</p>

<div class="sponsors section">
  <table id="showcase">
    <% data.sponsors.each_slice(3) do |slice| %>
      <tr>
        <% slice.each do |user| %>
          <td>
            <a href="<%= user.url %>" rel="nofollow">
              <img src="/images/about/<%= user.image %>">
            </a>
          </td>
        <% end %>
      </tr>
    <% end %>
  </table>

<!-- This next section is here for smaller sponsors; all those listed above have contributed tens-to-hundreds of thousands of dollars in time/cash.
 -->
<!-- <p>
  We'd also like the thank the following folks for their generous support:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Test small supporter 1</li>
  <li>Test small supporter 2</li>
  <li>Test small supporter 3</li>
</ul> -->

</div>
