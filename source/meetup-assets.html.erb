  Ember Meetup Assets
</h1>

<p>

  We've created Meetup group badges and branding to help give our groups a consistent feel. You can create your own by 
  <a href="/images/meetups/EmberMeetUp_180x135.psd">downloading the PSD</a>. We've got some other materials in the works and will post them here and email the organizers' Google Group as things come together.
</p>

<p>
  If you're using Meetup.com to manage your group, you can also use <a href="/images/meetups/MeetupHeader_960x150.psd">this header template</a> for your group's pages. It's optimized for Meetup (960 x 150); you can just add your location and you're good to go.

    Stickers

  <p>
    The Ember Core Team has a small stash of Ember stickers donated by the folks at <a href="http://tilde.io">Tilde</a>. These are distributed as requested while in stock. If you'd like to print your own Ember stickers, here are the files you'll need for the canonical ones.
