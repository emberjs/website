<p>
  Running an Ember User Group can be challenging, but <em>really</em> rewarding: thanks so much for stepping up! We're here to help however we can. <a href="mailto:meetups@emberjs.com">Reach out to Leah and Kait</a> if you have questions, ideas, or anything else User Group / Meetup related.
</p>

<p>
  If you're looking for a little help getting started, <a href="/community/meetups-getting-started">we've put together some starter tips for you</a>. Hope it's helpful!

  <h2>Branding Materials</h2>

  <p>
    We've created user group badges and branding to help give our groups a consistent feel. You can create your own by 
    <a href="/images/meetups/EmberMeetUp_180x135.psd">downloading the PSD</a>. We've got some other materials in the works and will post them here and email the organizers' Google Group as things come together.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're using Meetup.com to manage your group, you can also use <a href="/images/meetups/MeetupHeader_960x150.psd">this header template</a> for your group's pages. It's optimized for Meetup (960 x 150); you can just add your location and you're good to go.

  <h2>Logos</h2>

  <p>
    If you have questions about acceptable uses of the Ember logo, or other format requests, please <a href="mailto:leah@emberjs.com">get in touch</a>. In general, manipulations of any sort are not allowed. 
  </p>

  <ul class="inline_list">
    <li><a href="/images/logos/ember-logo.ai">Logo in Illustrator format</a></li>
    <li><a href="/images/logos/ember-logo.png">Logo in PNG format, transparent background</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Stickers</h2>

  <p>
    The Ember Core Team has a small stash of Ember stickers donated by the folks at <a href="http://tilde.io">Tilde</a>. These are distributed as requested while in stock. If you'd like to print your own Ember stickers, here are the files you'll need for the canonical ones.
  </p>

  <ul class="inline_list">
    <li><a href="/images/stickers/ember-sticker.ai">Ember Logo Stickers</a>, best printed die-cut at 3.0" x 1.25"</li>
    <li><a href="/images/stickers/tomster-sticker.ai">Ember Mascot Stickers</a>, best printed die-cut at 3" x 3"</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We recommend printing your stickers with <a href="http://www.stickermule.com/unlock?ref_id=3368978601">StickerMule</a>, who are long time supporters of Open Source. The link here will also get you $10 off your first order.

  <h2>Organizers Groups</h2>
    <p>
      There's an infrquently-used but future-helpful group of Ember Meetup Organizers, which we use for organizer chit chat and announcements. <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ember-meetup-organizers">You can apply to join the group here</a>. Be sure to list what group you're a part of in your application to ensure acceptance.
    </p>

    <p>
      There's also an Ember Meetup Organizer Slack Channel, which we're happy to add new organizers to. <a href="mailto:meetups@emberjs.com">Reach out via email to be added</a>, and be sure to specify what group you're working on.

      Custom Tomsters
      </h2>

      <p>
        You may have noticed that some user groups (Salt Lake City, Munich, London, etc.) have their own custom Tomster variants. These have been commissioned and licensed by the groups; they paid a small commission fee to have the Tomster designed by one of the official designers, and we granted them a license to use that variant for non-commercial user group related purposes.
      </p>

      <p class="tomsterVar">

        <a href="http://emberlondon.com/">
          <img width="180px" src="/images/community/tomsters/Ember-London-Half-sm.png">
        </a>
      </p>
    
      <p>
          Thankfully, our designers love Ember and therefor give us ridiculously fair pricing. Pricing ranges from $80 to $300, depending on the extent of the request. On average, most user groups spend $200.
      </p>
      <p>
          We're aiming to put up a form for this one of these days, but in the meantime, if you're interested in commissioning a Tomster, <a href="mailto:meetups@emberjs.com">send us an email to discuss</a>. They're super fun to make happen.
