## Creating an Application

The first step in creating an Ember.js application is to make an
instance of `Ember.Application`:

```javascript
window.App = Ember.Application.create();
```

Here we've called our application `App`, but you can call it whatever
makes the most sense for your application.

Having an application object is important for several reasons:

1. It is your application's namespace. All of the classes in your application will
   be defined as properties on this object (e.g., `App.PostsView` and
   `App.PostsController`). This helps to prevent polluting the global scope.
2. It adds event listeners to the document and is responsible for
   sending events to your views.
3. It automatically renders the [_application
   template_](the-application-template), the root-most
   template, into which your other templates will be rendered.
4. It automatically creates a router and begins routing, based on the
   current URL.
