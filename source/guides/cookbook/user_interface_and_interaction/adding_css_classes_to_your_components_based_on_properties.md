### Problem
You want to add or remove CSS class names to your Ember Components based on properties of the component.

### Solution
Add property names to the `classNameBindings` property of subclassed components.

### Discussion

You can apply classes based on properties of the component, or even by properties bound to data passed into the component.This is done by binding the class attribute using `classNameBindings`.

```js
classNameBindings: ['active'],
active: true
```

You can also set the class name based on a computed property.

```js
classNameBindings: ['isActive'],
isActive: function() {
  return 'active';
}.property('someAttribute')
```

Another way would be to bind the class name to a bound property.

```js
classNameBindings: ['isEnabled:enabled:disabled'],
isRelatedBinding: "content.isRelated" // value resolves to boolean
```
