## Problem

You want to add a dynamic text-box on click of a button after a list of items for the user to type in another item. Similarly on click of a button, you want to add a new row in an existing table with all the columns being input boxes where you can fill in and on focus-out the input boxes disappear writing their content directly in the td element.

A jsbin showing the feature we need is this.
