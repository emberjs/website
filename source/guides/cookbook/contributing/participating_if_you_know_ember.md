### Problem
You are familiar with Ember and want to help write the Cookbook.

### Solution
Get started by [forking the repository][fork_repo]. Send a pull request with an
update to an existing recipe or a new recipe.

### Discussion
Based on your experience and knowledge of Ember, we recommend submitting pull requests with the following:

<dl>
  <dt>Beginner</dt>
  <dd><em>Problem</em> statements are a good place for anyone to start helping. Feel free to submit pull requests that are just problem statements if there is a recipe you'd like to see. If you're new to Ember and/or haven't ever written an Ember app, this is a perfect place to start contributing.</dd>
  <dt>Intermediate</dt>
  <dd><em>Problem</em> &amp; <em>Solution</em> statements are a great way to participate if you're already writing Ember applications and have a known good solution to a particular problem statement. Feel free to leave _Discussion_ missing for someone else to fill out later.</dd>
  <dt>Advanced</dt>
  <dd><em>Problem</em>, <em>Solution</em> &amp; <em>Discussion</em> is the right way to help if you have a deeper understanding of the topic and can write cogently about why the solution is a good idea, explain pitfalls of other solutions, etc.</dd>
</dl>

You will be able to suggest possible recipes by forking this project and submitting a pull request with a new recipe (see [Suggesting a Recipe][suggesting_a_recipe]).
