## Problem
You'd like to submit a possible recipe.

## Solution
[Fork the repository][fork_repo] and create a feature branch named after your recipe. Add a recipe providing a _title_, _problem_ statement, _solution_ statement, and empty discussion section.

## Discussion
A [feature branch][feature_branch] is a branch in a local git repository with a name describing the suggested feature. You should name this branch the camel cased or underscored version of your recipe name. The branch name for this recipe "Suggesting a Recipe" would be "`SuggestingARecipe`" or "`suggesting_a_recipe`".

Your _title_, _problem_, and _solution_ text should match the Cookbook style (see [Understanding the Cookbook Format][understanding]). For now, please leave the _discussion_ section empty. We'll fill this in during a later phase of the project.

The file name of your suggested recipe should be the lowercase underscored version of your recipe's name. The filename name for this recipe "Suggesting a Recipe" would be "`suggesting_a_recipe.md`".

When you are ready, push your local branch to the remote branch on your Github fork and submit a pull request.

Before submitting a pull request, check to see that someone hasn't already submitted a similar recipe and ensure that your recipe is a good fit (see [Deciding If A Recipe Is A Good Fit][deciding]).
