### Problem
You are new to Ember, but want to help write the Cookbook.

### Solution
Suggest and/or submit pull requests with a _problem_ statement (see [Suggesting A Recipe](/guides/cookbook/contributing/suggesting_a_recipe)). You do not need to worry about providing a solution or discussion. Someone more experienced with Ember will be able to take your _problem_ and provide a _solution_ and _discussion_.

### Discussion
The first version of the Ember Cookbook will be completed in a few phases. First, we will be accepting
recipe suggestions. You can suggest a recipe by forking this repository and submitting a pull request
(see _Suggesting a Recipe_). Once we have written recipes, we'll be asking for help to proofread and test
them.

See ["Watch a project"](http://help.github.com/be-social/) on Github for information on watching projects.
