## Problem
You have a possible recipe but aren't sure it is a good fit for a Cookbook.

## Solution
Borrow or buy an existing Cookbook or read sample chapters of cookbooks online. Scope the recipe so it explores a single problem.

## Discussion
*The Cookbook format is targeted at an audience with beginner skills.* They have ideally read through a few tutorials and built a small demonstration application using Ember. Recipes are intended to guide them towards better understanding of intermediate and advanced topics. Recipes should focus on skills a beginner should ideally know. Especially good possibilities for recipes are frequently asked Ember questions on sites like StackOverflow.

The scope of a recipe should be the solution to a single problem addressed in a problem statement and should not cover multiple topics. "Syncing Data With One-way Bindings" or "Integrating Ember with moment.js" are excellent single problem recipes. "Building An Entire Ember Application with Node.js as a backend" or "Creating a GridView with Sortable Fields and A Searchbar and Connecting It To Rails" are scoped too large and should be broken into their component recipes (e.g. "Organizing an Ember Application", "Responding to User Events", "Connecting to Remote Data", etc).
