The Ember Cookbook provides answers and solutions to common Ember questions and problems. Anyone is welcome to
[contribute](/guides/cookbook/contributing/understanding_the_cookbook_format).

If you are new to Ember, we recommend that you spend some time reading the guides and tutorials before coming
to the Cookbook. Cookbook recipes assume that you have a basic understanding of Ember's concepts.

If you have experience with Ember and would like to contribute to the Cookbook, the discussion section of each
recipe is a great place to start.
