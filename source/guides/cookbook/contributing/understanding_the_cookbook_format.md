## Problem
You want to contribute, but aren't familiar with the Cookbook format or don't know
how your contribution should be formatted.

## Solution
Cookbook-style guides contain recipes that guide a beginning programmer to a deeper knowledge of the subject
by answering specific, "how-to" style questions. Cookbook recipes address more topics than
[API documentation for a class](http://docs.emberjs.com/#doc=Ember.StateManager&src=fal), but are smaller in
scope than [a topic-based guide](http://emberjs.com/guides/view_layer/).

All recipes follow the same format:

<dl>
  <dt>Title</dt>
  <dd>Broadly explains the topic of the recipe</dd>
  <dt>Problem</dt>
  <dd>Outlines the recipe's goals</dd>
  <dt>Solution</dt>
  <dd>Summarizes the correct approach to addressing the problem</dd>
  <dt>Discussion</dt>
  <dd>Explores the solution in detail</dd>
</dl>

A Cookbook does not need to be read in any particular order, and each recipe should contain all the information
necessary for a beginner to address the _problem statement_. Referring to other recipes that are considered
prerequisite knowledge is encouraged.

## Discussion
Take a look at an [O'Reilly Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/category/series/cookbooks.do) or the
[Coffeescript Cookbook](http://coffeescriptcookbook.com/). Both of these are great examples of the Cookbook
format.
