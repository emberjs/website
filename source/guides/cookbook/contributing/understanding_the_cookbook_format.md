## Problem
You want to contribute to the Ember Cookbook but are unsure of how the contribution should be formatted and what type of content it should contain.

## Solution
Programming Cookbooks contain "recipes" that guide a programmer who understands the beginnings of a topic into stronger skill with a technology by answering specific "how-to" style questions.  Cookbook recipes cover a single desired outcome across many different areas of concern within a single technology: they cover more topics than [API documentation for a class][api_docs_for_class] but are smaller in scope than [a topic-based guide][topic_based_guide].

Recipes follow a patterned format: 

<dl>
  <dt>Title</dt>
  <dd>The title should explain the broad topic of the recipe. The title often, but not always, begins with a gerund ("Creating", "Managing", "Updating", "Accessing", "Using", etc).</dd>
  <dt>Problem</dt>
  <dd>The problem statement should outline a reader's goal.</dd>
  <dt>Solution</dt>
  <dd>The solution should quickly summarize the correct approach to address the problem statement.</dd>
  <dt>Discussion</dt>
  <dd>The discussion should explore the solution in detail.</dd>
</dl>

A Cookbook does not need to be read in any particular order and each recipe should contain all the information necessary for someone with beginner skills to address the _problem_ statement. 

*Referring to other recipes that are considered prerequisite knowledge is encouraged.*

## Discussion
For a better understanding and to see some examples, peruse some [O'Reilly Cookbooks][oreilly_cookbooks] or the [Coffeescript Cookbook][coffeescript_cookbook] to understand the format.
