## Models

In Ember, every route has an associated model. This model is set by
implementing a route's `model` hook, by passing the model as an argument
to `{{link-to}}`, or by calling a route's `transitionTo()` method.

See [Specifying a Route's
Model](/guides/routing/specifying-a-routes-model) for more information
on setting a route's model.

For simple applications, you can get by using jQuery to load JSON data
from a server, then use those JSON objects as models.

However, using a model library that manages finding models, making
changes, and saving them back to the server can dramatically simplify
your code while improving the robustness and performance of your
application.

Many Ember apps use [Ember Data][emberdata] to handle this.
Ember Data is a library that integrates tightly with Ember.js to make it
easy to retrieve records from a server, cache them for performance,
save updates back to the server, and create new records on the client.

Without any configuration, Ember Data can load and save records and
their relationships served via a RESTful JSON API, provided it follows
certain conventions.

If you need to integrate your Ember.js app with existing JSON APIs that
do not follow strong conventions, Ember Data is designed to be easily
configurable to work with whatever data your server returns.

Ember Data is also designed to work with streaming APIs like
socket.io, Firebase, or WebSockets. You can open a socket to your server
and push changes to records into the store whenever they occur.

Currently, Ember Data ships as a separate library from Ember.js.  Until
Ember Data is included as part of the standard distribution, you can get

### Core Concepts

Learning to use Ember Data is easiest once you understand some of the
concepts that underpin its design.

#### Store

The **store** is the central repository of records in your application.
You can think of the store as a cache of all of the records available in
your app. Both your application's controllers and routes have access to this
shared store; when they need to display or modify a record, they will
first ask the store for it.

This instance of `DS.Store` is created for you automatically and is shared
among all of the objects in your application.

You will use the store to retrieve records, as well to create new ones.
For example, we might want to find an `App.Person` model with the ID of
`1` from our route's `model` hook:

```js
App.IndexRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
  model: function() {
    return this.store.find('person', 1);
  }
});
```

#### Models

A **model** is a class that defines the properties and behavior of the
data that you present to the user. Anything that the user expects to see
if they leave your app and come back later (or if they refresh the page)
should be represented by a model.

For example, if you were writing a web application for placing orders at
a restaurant, you might have models like `Order`, `LineItem`, and
`MenuItem`.

Fetching orders becomes very easy:

```js
this.store.find('order');
```

Models define the type of data that will be provided by your server. For
example, a `Person` model might have a `firstName` attribute that is a
string, and a `birthday` attribute that is a date:

```js
App.Person = DS.Model.extend({
  firstName: DS.attr('string'),
  birthday:  DS.attr('date')
});
```

A model also describes its relationships with other objects. For
example, an `Order` may have many `LineItems`, and a `LineItem` may
belong to a particular `Order`.

```js
App.Order = DS.Model.extend({
  lineItems: DS.hasMany('lineItem')
});

App.LineItem = DS.Model.extend({
  order: DS.belongsTo('order')
});
```

Models don't have any data themselves; they just define the properties and
behavior of specific instances, which are called _records_.

#### Records

A **record** is an instance of a model that contains data loaded from a
server. Your application can also create new records and save them back
to the server.

Records are uniquely identified by two things:

1. A model type.
2. A globally unique ID.

For example, if you were writing a contact management app, you might
have a model called `Person`. An individual record in your app might
have a type of `Person` and an ID of `1` or `steve-buscemi`.

```js
this.store.find('person', 1); // => { id: 1, name: 'steve-buscemi' }
```

IDs are usually assigned by the server when you save them for the first
time, but you can also generate IDs client-side.

#### Adapter

An **adapter** is an object that knows about your particular server
backend and is responsible for translating requests for and changes to
records into the appropriate calls to your server.

For example, if your application asks for a `person` record with an ID
of `1`, how should Ember Data load it? Is it over HTTP or a WebSocket?
If it's HTTP, is the URL `/person/1` or `/resources/people/1`?

The adapter is responsible for answering all of these questions.
Whenever your app asks the store for a record that it doesn't have
cached, it will ask the adapter for it. If you change a record and save
it, the store will hand the record to the adapter to send the
appropriate data to your server and confirm that the save was
successful.

#### Serializer

A **serializer** is responsible for turning a raw JSON payload returned
from your server into a record object.

JSON APIs may represent attributes and relationships in many different
ways. For example, some attribute names may be `camelCased` and others
may be `under_scored`. Representing relationships is even more diverse:
they may be encoded as an array of IDs, an array of embedded objects, or
as foreign keys.

When the adapter gets a payload back for a particular record, it will
give that payload to the serializer to normalize into the form that
Ember Data is expecting.

While most people will use a serializer for normalizing JSON, because
Ember Data treats these payloads as opaque objects, there's no reason
they couldn't be binary data stored in a `Blob` or
[ArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays/ArrayBuffer).

#### Automatic Caching

The store will automatically cache records for you. If a record had already
been loaded, asking for it a second time will always return the same
object instance. This minimizes the number of round-trips to the
server, and allows your application to render UI to the user as fast as
possible.

For example, the first time your application asks the store for a
`person` record with an ID of `1`, it will fetch that information from
your server.

However, the next time your app asks for a `person` with ID `1`, the
store will notice that it had already retrieved and cached that
information from the server. Instead of sending another request for the
same information, it will give your application the same record it had
provided it the first time.  This feature—always returning the same
record object, no matter how many times you look it up—is sometimes
called an _identity map_.

Using an identity map is important because it ensures that changes you
make in one part of your UI are propagated to other parts of the UI. It
also means that you don't have to manually keep records in sync—you can
ask for a record by ID and not have to worry about whether other parts
of your application have already asked for and loaded it.

### Architecture Overview

The first time your application asks the store for a record, the store
sees that it doesn't have a local copy and requests it from your
adapter. Your adapter will go and retrieve the record from your
persistence layer; typically, this will be a JSON representation of the
record served from an HTTP server.

![Diagram showing process for finding an unloaded record](/images/guides/models/finding-unloaded-record-step1-diagram.png)

As illustrated in the diagram above, the adapter cannot always return the 
requested record immediately. In this case, the adapter must make an 
_asynchronous_ request to the server, and only when that request finishes 
loading can the record be created with its backing data.

Because of this asynchronicity, the store immediately returns a
_promise_ from the `find()` method. Similarly, any requests that the
store makes to the adapter also return promises.

Once the request to the server returns with a JSON payload for the
requested record, the adapter resolves the promise it returned to the
store with the JSON.

The store then takes that JSON, initializes the record with the
JSON data, and resolves the promise returned to your application
with the newly-loaded record.

![Diagram showing process for finding an unloaded record after the payload has returned from the server](/images/guides/models/finding-unloaded-record-step2-diagram.png)

Let's look at what happens if you request a record that the store
already has in its cache. 

![Diagram showing process for finding an unloaded record after the payload has returned from the server](/images/guides/models/finding-loaded-record-diagram.png)

In this case, because the store already knew about the record, it
returns a promise that it resolves with the record immediately. It does
not need to ask the adapter (and, therefore, the server) for a copy
since it already has it saved locally.

Ember Data. The following sections go into more depth about each of
these concepts, and how to use them together.
