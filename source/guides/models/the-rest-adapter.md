## The REST Adapter

By default, your store will use `DS.RESTAdapter` to load and save
records. The REST adapter assumes that the URLs and JSON associated with
each model are conventional; this means that, if you follow the rules,
you will not need to configure the adapter or write any code in order to
get started.

### URL Conventions

The REST adapter is smart enough to determine the URLs it communicates
with based on the name of the model. For example, if you ask for a
`Post` by ID:

```js
var post = App.Post.find(1);
```

The REST adapter will automatically send a `GET` request to `/posts/1`.

The actions you can take on a record map onto the following URLs in the
REST adapter:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Action</th><th>HTTP Verb</th><th>URL</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><th>Find</th><td>GET</td><td>/people/123</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Find All</th><td>GET</td><td>/people</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Update</th><td>PUT</td><td>/people/123</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Create</th><td>POST</td><td>/people</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Delete</th><td>DELETE</td><td>/people/123</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Pluralization Customization

Irregular pluralizations can be specified via the adapter's `configure`
API:

```js
DS.RESTAdapter.configure("plurals", {
  person: "people"
});
```

This will tell the REST adapter that requests for `App.Person` requests
should go to `/people/1` instead of `/persons/1`.

#### Endpoint Path Customization

Endpoint paths can be prefixed with a namespace by setting the `namespace`
property on the adapter:

```js
DS.RESTAdapter.reopen({
  namespace: 'api/1'
});
```

Requests for `App.Person` would now target `/api/1/people/1`.

#### Host Customization

An adapter can target other hosts by setting the `url` property.

```js
DS.RESTAdapter.reopen({
  url: 'https://api.example.com'
});
```

Requests for `App.Person` would now target `https://api.example.com/people/1`.

### JSON Conventions

When requesting a record, the REST adapter expects your server to return
a JSON representation of the record that conforms to the following
conventions.

#### JSON Root

The primary record being returned should be in a named root. For
example, if you request a record from `/people/123`, the response should
be nested inside a property called `person`:

```js
{
  "person": {
    "first_name": "Jeff",
    "last_name": "Atwood"
  }
}
```

#### Underscored Attribute Names

Attribute names should be the underscored version of the attribute name
in your Ember Data models. For example, if you have a model like this:

```js
App.Person = DS.Model.extend({
  firstName: DS.attr('string'),
  lastName: DS.attr('string'),

  isPersonOfTheYear: DS.attr('boolean')
});
```

The JSON returned from your server should look like this:

```js
{
  "person": {
    "first_name": "Barack",
    "last_name": "Obama",
    "is_person_of_the_year": true
  }
}
```

Irregular keys can be mapped on the adapter. If the JSON
has a key of `lastNameOfPerson`, and the desired attribute
name is simply `lastName`, inform the adapter:

```js
App.Person = DS.Model.extend({
  lastName: DS.attr('string')
});
DS.RESTAdapter.map('App.Person', {
  lastName: { key: 'lastNameOfPerson' }
});
```

#### Relationships

References to other records should be done by ID. For example, if you
have a model with a `hasMany` relationship:

```js
App.Post = DS.Model.extend({
  comments: DS.hasMany('App.Comment')
});
```

The JSON should encode the relationship as an array of IDs:

```js
{
  "post": {
    "comment_ids": [1, 2, 3]
  }
}
```

`Comments` for a `post` can be loaded by `post.get('comments')`. The REST adapter
will send a `GET` request to `/comments?ids[]=1&ids[]=2&ids[]=3`.

Any `belongsTo` relationships in the JSON representation should be the
underscored version of the Ember Data model's name, with the string
`_id` appended. For example, if you have a model:

```js
App.Comment = DS.Model.extend({
  post: DS.belongsTo('App.Post')
});
```

The JSON should encode the relationship as an ID to another record:

```js
{
  "comment": {
    "post_id": 1
  }
}
```

#### Sideloaded Relationships

To reduce the number of HTTP requests necessary, you can sideload
additional records in your JSON response. Sideloaded records live
outside the JSON root, and are represented as an array of hashes:

```js
{
  "post": {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Rails is omakase",
    "comment_ids": [1, 2, 3]
  },

  "comments": [{
    "id": 1,
    "body": "But is it _lightweight_ omakase?"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "body": "I for one welcome our new omakase overlords"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "body": "Put me on the fast track to a delicious dinner"
  }]
}
```

### Creating Custom Transformations

In some circumstances, the built in attribute types of `string`,
`number`, `boolean`, and `date` may be inadequate. For example, a
server may return a non-standard date format.

The `RESTAdapter`, like any Ember adapter, can have new tranforms
registered for use as attributes:

```js
DS.RESTAdapter.registerTransform('coordinatePoint', {
  serialize: function(value) {
    return [value.get('x'), value.get('y')];
  },
  deserialize: function(value) {
    return Ember.create({ x: value[0], y: value[1] });
  }
});
App.Cursor = DS.Model.extend({
  position: DS.attr('coordinatePoint')
});
```

When `coordinatePoint` is recieved from the API, it is
expected to be an array:

```js
{
  cursor: {
    position: [4,9]
  }
}
```

But once loaded on a model instance, it will behave as an object:

```js
var cursor = App.Cursor.find(1);
cursor.get('position.x'); //=> 4
cursor.get('position.y'); //=> 9
```

If `position` is modified and saved, it will pass through the
`serialize` function in the transform and again be presented as
an array in JSON.
