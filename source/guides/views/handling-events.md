## Handling Events

Instead of having to register event listeners on elements you'd like to
respond to, simply implement the name of the event you want to respond to
as a method on your view.

For example, imagine we have a template like this:

```handlebars
{{#view App.ClickableView}}
This is a clickable area!
{{/view}}
```

Let's implement `App.ClickableView` such that when it is
clicked, an alert is displayed:

```javascript
App.ClickableView = Ember.View.extend({
  click: function(evt) {
    alert("ClickableView was clicked!");
  }
});
```

Events bubble up from the target view to each parent view in succession,
until the root view. These values are read-only. If you want to
manually manage views in JavaScript (instead of creating them using
the `{{view}}` helper in Handlebars), see the `Ember.ContainerView`
documentation below.

###Sending Events

To have the click event from `App.ClickableView` affect the state of your application, simply send an event to the view's controller:

````javascript
App.ClickableView = Ember.View.extend({
  click: function(evt) {
    this.get('controller').send('turnItUp', 11);
  }
});
````

If the controller has an action handler called `turnItUp`, it will be called:


````javascript
App.PlaybackController = Ember.ObjectController.extend({
  actions: {
    turnItUp: function(level){
      //Do your thing
    }
  }
});
````

If it doesn't, the message will be passed to the current route:

````javascript
App.PlaybackRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
  actions: {
    turnItUp: function(level){
      //This won't be called if it's defined on App.PlaybackController
    }
  }
});
````
