## Inserting Views in Templates

So far, we've discussed writing templates for a single view. However, as your application grows, you will often want to create a hierarchy of views to encapsulate different areas on the page. Each view is responsible for handling events and maintaining the properties needed to display it.

### {{view}}

To add a child view to a parent, use the `{{view}}` helper, which takes a path to a view class.

```javascript
// Define parent view
App.UserView = Ember.View.extend({
  templateName: 'user',

  firstName: "Albert",
  lastName: "Hofmann"
});

// Define child view
App.InfoView = Ember.View.extend({
  templateName: 'info',

  posts: 25,
  hobbies: "Riding bicycles"
});
```

```handlebars
User: {{firstName}} {{lastName}}
{{view App.InfoView}}
```

```handlebars
<b>Posts:</b> {{view.posts}}
<br>
<b>Hobbies:</b> {{view.hobbies}}
```

If we were to create an instance of `App.UserView` and render it, we would get
a DOM representation like this:

```html
User: Albert Hofmann
<div>
  <b>Posts:</b> 25
  <br>
  <b>Hobbies:</b> Riding bicycles
</div>
```

#### Relative Paths

Instead of specifying an absolute path, you can also specify which view class
to use relative to the parent view. For example, we could nest the above view
hierarchy like this:

```javascript
App.UserView = Ember.View.extend({
  templateName: 'user',

  firstName: "Albert",
  lastName: "Hofmann",

  infoView: Ember.View.extend({
    templateName: 'info',

    posts: 25,
    hobbies: "Riding bicycles"
  })
});
```

```handlebars
User: {{firstName}} {{lastName}}
{{view infoView}}
```

When nesting a view class like this, make sure to use a lowercase
letter, as Ember will interpret a property with a capital letter as a
global property.

### Setting Child View Templates

If you'd like to specify the template your child views use inline in
the main template, you can use the block form of the `{{view}}` helper.
We might rewrite the above example like this:

```javascript
App.UserView = Ember.View.extend({
  templateName: 'user',

  firstName: "Albert",
  lastName: "Hofmann"
});

App.InfoView = Ember.View.extend({
  posts: 25,
  hobbies: "Riding bicycles"
});
```

```handlebars
User: {{firstName}} {{lastName}}
{{#view App.InfoView}}
  <b>Posts:</b> {{view.posts}}
  <br>
  <b>Hobbies:</b> {{view.hobbies}}
{{/view}}
```

When you do this, it may be helpful to think of it as assigning views to
portions of the page. This allows you to encapsulate event handling for just
that part of the page.
