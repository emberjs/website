The inspector provides a way to look at all the promises being created
in your application. Click on the `Promises` menu to start inspecting
your promises.

You can see a hierarchical list of promises with labels describing each
promise, its state, settled value, and the time it took to
settle.


### Promise States and Filtering

Promises will have different colors based on their state.

You can filter promises by state by clicking on one of the following
pills: `Rejected`, `Pending`, `Fulfilled`.

You can also search for promises by typing a query in the search box.

To clear the currently logged promises, click on the clear icon on the
top left of the tab.

### Inspecting Settled Values

If the fulfillment value is an Ember object or an array, you can click
on that object to open it in the object inspector.

If the rejection value is an `Error` object, you can send its stack trace to
the console.

You can also click on the `$E` button to send the value to the console.

### Tracing

The inspector provides a way to view a promise's stack trace.
Tracing promises is disabled by default for performance reasons. To
enable tracing, check the `Trace promise` checkbox. You may want to
reload to trace existing promises.

To trace a promise, click on the `Trace` button next to the label,
which will send the promise stack trace to the console.

### Labeling Promises

Promises generated by Ember.js are all labeled by default.
You can also label your own RSVP promises to find them in the inspector's Promises tab.
All RSVP methods can take a label as the final argument.

```javascript

var label = 'Find Posts'

new RSVP.Promise(method, label);

RSVP.Promise.resolve(value, label);

RSVP.Promise.reject(reason, label);

RSVP.Promise.all(array, label);

RSVP.Promise.hash(hash, label);

promise.then(success, failure, label);

promise.catch(callback, label);

promise.finally(callback, label);

```
