## The `{{link-to}}` Helper

You create a link to a route using the `{{link-to}}` helper.

```js
App.Router.map(function() {
  this.resource("photos", function(){
    this.route("edit", { path: "/:photo_id" });
  });
});
```

```handlebars
{{! photos.handlebars }}

<ul>
{{#each photo in photos}}
  <li>{{#link-to 'photos.edit' photo}}{{photo.title}}{{/link-to}}</li>
{{/each}}
</ul>
```

If the model for the `photos` template is a list of three photos, the
rendered HTML would look something like this:

```html
<ul>
  <li><a href="/photos/1">Happy Kittens</a></li>
  <li><a href="/photos/2">Puppy Running</a></li>
  <li><a href="/photos/3">Mountain Landscape</a></li>
</ul>
```

When the rendered link matches the current route, and the same
object instance is passed into the helper, then the link is given
`class="active"`.

The `{{link-to}}` helper takes:

* The name of a route. In this example, it would be `index`, `photos`, or
  `photos.edit`.
* At most one model for each [dynamic segment](/guides/routing/defining-your-routes/#toc_dynamic-segments).
  By default, Ember.js will replace each segment with the value of the corresponding object's `id` property.
  If there is no model to pass to the helper, you can provide an explicit identifier value instead.
  The value will be filled into the [dynamic segment](/guides/routing/defining-your-routes/#toc_dynamic-segments)
  of the route, and will make sure that the `model` hook is triggered.
* An optional title which will be bound to the `a` title attribute

```handlebars
{{! photos.handlebars }}

{{#link-to 'photo.edit' 1}}
  First Photo Ever
{{/link-to}}
```

### Example for Multiple Segments

If the route is nested, you can supply a model or an identifier for each dynamic
segment.

```js
App.Router.map(function() {
  this.resource("photos", function(){
    this.resource("photo", { path: "/:photo_id" }, function(){
      this.route("comments");
      this.route("comment", { path: "/comments/:comment_id" });
    });
  });
});
```

```handlebars
<!-- photoIndex.handlebars -->

<div class="photo">
  {{body}}
</div>

<p>{{#link-to 'photo.comment' primaryComment}}Main Comment{{/link-to}}</p>
```

If you specify only one model, it will represent the innermost dynamic segment `:comment_id`.
The `:photo_id` segment will use the current photo.

Alternatively, you could pass both a photo and a comment to the helper:

```handlebars
<p>
  {{#link-to 'photo.comment' 5 primaryComment}}
    Main Comment for the Next Photo
  {{/link-to}}
</p>
```

In the above example, the model hook for `PhotoRoute` will run with `params.photo_id = 5`.  The `model` hook for
`CommentRoute` _won't_ run since you supplied a model object for the `comment` segment. The comment's id will
populate the url according to `CommentRoute`'s `serialize` hook.

### Adding additional attributes on a link

When generating a link you might want to set additional attributes for it. You can do this with additional
arguments to the `link-to` helper:

```handlebars
<p>
  {{link-to 'photo.edit' photo class="btn btn-primary"}}
</p>
```

Many of the common HTML properties you would want to use like `class`, and `rel` will work. When
adding class names, Ember will also apply the standard `ember-view` and possibly `active` class names.
