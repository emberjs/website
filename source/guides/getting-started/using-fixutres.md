## Using Fixtures

Now we'll add fixture data. Fixtures are a way to put sample data into an application before connecting the application to long-term persistence.

Update the file at `js/todo.js` to include the following fixture data:

```javascript
// ... additional lines truncated for brevity ...
Todos.Todo.FIXTURES = [
 {
   id: 1,
   title: 'Learn Ember.js',
   isCompleted: true
 },
 {
   id: 2,
   title: '...',
   isCompleted: false
 },
 {
   id: 3,
   title: 'Profit!',
   isCompleted: false
 }
];
```

Reload your web browser to ensure that all files have been referenced correctly and no errors occur.
