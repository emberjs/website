TodoMVC strikes through completed todos by applying a CSS class `completed` to the `<li>` element. Update `index.html` to apply a CSS class to this element when a todo's `isCompleted` property is true:

```handlebars
<!--- ... additional lines truncated for brevity ... -->
<li {{bind-attr class="isCompleted:completed"}}>
  <input type="checkbox" class="toggle">
  <label>{{title}}</label><button class="destroy"></button>
</li>
<!--- ... additional lines truncated for brevity ... -->
```

This code will apply the CSS class `completed` when the todo's `isCompleted` property is `true` and remove it when the property becomes `false`.

The first fixture todo in our application has an `isCompleted` property of `true`. Reload the application to see the first todo is now decorated with a strike-through to visually indicate it has been completed.
