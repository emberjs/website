Next we will create a model class to describe todo items. 

Create a file at `js/models/todo.js` and put the following code inside:

```javascript
Todos.Todo = DS.Model.extend({
  title: DS.attr('string'),
  isCompleted: DS.attr('boolean')
});
```

This code creates a new class `Todo` and places it within your application's namespace. Each todo will have two attributes: `title` and `isCompleted`.

You may place this file anywhere you like (even just putting all code into the same file), but this guide will assume you have created a file and named it as indicated.

Finally, update your `index.html` to include a reference to this new file:

```html
<!-- ... additional lines truncated for brevity ... -->
  <script src="js/models/todo.js"></script>
</body>
<!-- ... additional lines truncated for brevity ... -->
```

Reload your web browser to ensure that all files have been referenced correctly and no errors occur.
