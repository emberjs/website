In the router, each URL is associated with one or more _route handlers_.
The route handler is responsible for converting the URL into a model
object, telling a controller to represent that model, then rendering a
template bound to that controller.

### Singleton Models

If a route does not have a dynamic segment, you can hardcode which model
should be associated with that URL by implementing the route handler's
`model` hook:

```js
App.Router.map(function() {
  this.resource('posts');
});

App.PostsRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
  model: function() {
    return App.Post.find();
  }
});
```

By default, the value returned from your `model` hook will be assigned
to the `model` property of the `posts` controller. You can change this
behavior by implementing the [setupControllers hook][1]. The `posts`
controller is the context for the `posts` template.

### Dynamic Models

If a route has a dynamic segment, you will want to use the parameters to
decide which model to use:

```js
App.Router.map(function() {
  this.resource('post', { path: '/posts/:post_id' });
});

App.PostRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
  model: function(params) {
    return App.Post.find(params.post_id);
  }
});
```

Because this pattern is so common, the above `model` hook is the
default behavior.

For example, if the dynamic segment is `:post_id`, Ember.js is smart
enough to know that it should use the model `App.Post` (with the ID
provided in the URL). Specifically, unless you override `model`, the route will
return `App.Post.find(params.post_id)` automatically.

Not coincidentally, this is exactly what Ember Data expects. So if you
use the Ember router with Ember Data, your dynamic segments will work
as expected out of the box.

Note: A route with a dynamic segment will only have its `model` hook called
when it is entered via the URL. If the route is entered through a transition
(e.g. when using the [link-to][2] Handlebars helper), then a model context is
already provided and the hook is not executed. Routes without dynamic segments
will always execute the model hook.
