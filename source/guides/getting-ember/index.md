##Ember Builds

The Ember Release Management Team maintains a variety of ways to get  Ember and Ember Data builds.

###Ember CLI
The best way to use Ember is with Ember CLI. It is recommended that developers use Ember CLI for any new projects and start migrating their apps to Ember CLI as soon as possible. See the [The Road to Ember 2.0 RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/15) for more info.

Begin by installing Ember CLI with npm, `npm install -g ember-cli` and then create your new app using `ember new app-name`. For more information about ember cli and all of its commands visit [http://www.ember-cli.com/](http://www.ember-cli.com/).

###Channels
The latest [Release](/builds#/release), [Beta](/builds#/beta), and [Canary](/builds#/canary) builds of Ember and Ember data can be found [here](/builds). For each channel a development, minified, and production version is available. For more on the different channels read the [Post 1.0 Release Cycle](/blog/2013/09/06/new-ember-release-process.html) blog post.

###Tagged Releases
Past release and beta builds  of Ember and Ember Data are available at [Tagged Releases](/builds#/tagged). These builds can be useful to track down regressions in your application, but it is recommended to use the latest stable release in production.



##Bower

Bower is a package manager for the web. Bower makes it easy to manage dependencies in your application including Ember and Ember Data. To learn more about Bower visit [http://bower.io/](http://bower.io/).

Adding Ember to your application with Bower is easy; simply run `bower install ember --save`. For Ember Data, run `bower install ember-data --save`. You can also add `ember` or `ember-data` to your `bower.json` file as follows.

```json
{
	"name": "your-app",
	"dependencies": {
		"ember": "~1.6",
		"ember-data": "~1.0.0-beta.8"
	}
}

```

##RubyGems

If your application uses a Ruby based build system, you can use the [ember-source](http://rubygems.org/gems/ember-source) and [ember-data-source](http://rubygems.org/gems/ember-data-source) RubyGems to access ember and ember data sources from Ruby.

If your application is built in Rails, the [ember-rails](http://rubygems.org/gems/ember-rails) RubyGem makes it easy to integrate Ember into your Ruby on Rails application.
