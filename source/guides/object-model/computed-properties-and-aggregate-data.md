## Computed Properties and Aggregate Data

Often, you may have a computed property that relies on all of the items in an
array to determine its value. For example, you may want to count all of the
todo items in a controller to determine how many of them are completed.

Here's what that computed property might look like:

```javascript
App.TodosController = Ember.Controller.extend({
  todos: [
    Ember.Object.create({ isDone: false })
  ],

  remaining: function() {
    var todos = this.get('todos');
    return todos.filterProperty('isDone', false).get('length');
  }.property('todos.@each.isDone')
});
```

Note here that the dependent key (`todos.@each.isDone`) contains the special
key `@each`. This instructs Ember.js to update bindings and fire observers for
this computed property when one of the following four events occurs:

1. The `isDone` property of any of the objects in the `todos` array changes.
2. An item is added to the `todos` array.
3. An item is removed from the `todos` array.
4. The `todos` property of the controller is changed to a different array.

In the example above, the `remaining` count is `1`:

```javascript
App.todosController = App.TodosController.create();
App.todosController.get('remaining');
// 1
```

If we change the todo's `isDone` property, the `remaining` property is updated
automatically:

```javascript
var todos = App.todosController.get('todos');
var todo = todos.objectAt(0);
todo.set('isDone', true);

App.todosController.get('remaining');
// 0

todo = Ember.Object.create({ isDone: false });
todos.pushObject(todo);

App.todosController.get('remaining');
// 1
```
