To define a new Ember _class_, call the `extend()` method on
`Ember.Object`:

```javascript
App.Person = Ember.Object.extend({
  say: function(thing) {
    alert(thing);
  }
});
```

This defines a new `App.Person` class with a `say()` method.

You can also create a _subclass_ from any existing class by calling
its `extend()` method. For example, you might want to create a subclass
of Ember's built-in `Ember.View` class:

```js
App.PersonView = Ember.View.extend({
  tagName: 'li',
  classNameBindings: ['isAdministrator']
});
```

When defining a subclass, you can override methods but still access the
implementation of your parent class by calling the special `_super()`
method:

```javascript
App.Person = Ember.Object.extend({
  say: function(thing) {
    var name = this.get('name');
    alert(name + " says: " + thing);
  }
});

App.Soldier = App.Person.extend({
  say: function(thing) {
    this._super(thing + ", sir!");
  }
});

var yehuda = App.Soldier.create({
  name: "Yehuda Katz"
});

yehuda.say("Yes"); // alerts "Yehuda Katz says: Yes, sir!"
```

### Creating Instances

Once you have defined a class, you can create new _instances_ of that
class by calling its `create()` method. Any methods, properties and
computed properties you defined on the class will be available to
instances:

```javascript
var person = App.Person.create();
person.say("Hello"); // alerts " says: Hello"
```

When creating an instance, you can initialize the value of its properties
by passing an optional hash to the `create()` method:

```javascript
App.Person = Ember.Object.extend({
  helloWorld: function() {
    alert("Hi, my name is " + this.get('name'));
  }
});

var tom = App.Person.create({
  name: "Tom Dale"
});

tom.helloWorld(); // alerts "Hi my name is Tom Dale"
```

For performance reasons, note that you cannot redefine an instance's
computed properties or methods when calling `create()`, nor can you
define new ones. You should only set simple properties when calling
`create()`. If you need to define or redefine methods or computed
properties, create a new subclass and instantiate that.

By convention, properties or variables that hold classes are
PascalCased, while instances are not. So, for example, the variable
`App.Person` would point to a class, while `person` would point to an instance
(usually of the `App.Person` class). You should stick to these naming
conventions in your Ember applications.

### Initializing Instances

When a new instance is created, its `init` method is invoked
automatically. This is the ideal place to do setup required on new
instances:

```js
App.Person = Ember.Object.extend({
  init: function() {
    var name = this.get('name');
    alert(name + ", reporting for duty!");
  }
});

App.Person.create({
  name: "Stefan Penner"
});

// alerts "Stefan Penner, reporting for duty!"
```

If you are subclassing a framework class, like `Ember.View` or
`Ember.ArrayController`, and you override the `init` method, make sure
you call `this._super()`! If you don't, the system may not have an
opportunity to do important setup work, and you'll see strange behavior
in your application.

When accessing the properties of an object, use the `get`
and `set` accessor methods:

```js
var person = App.Person.create();

var name = person.get('name');
person.set('name', "Tobias FÃ¼nke");
```

Make sure to use these accessor methods; otherwise, computed properties won't
recalculate, observers won't fire, and templates won't update.
