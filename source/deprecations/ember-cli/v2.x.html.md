## Deprecations Added in Ember CLI 2.x

### Deprecations Present in Ember CLI 2.0.0

#### Migrate from Brocfile.js to ember-cli-build.js

###### until: 3.0.0
###### id: cli.brocfile

Early versions of Ember CLI utilized the default build file of Broccoli: `Brocfile.js`. Over time
we began realizing that this was not a tenable solution (we could not pass high fidelity objects
into the build pipeline, and therefore created two instances of all addons, etc), and introduced a
replacement for `Brocfile.js`: `ember-cli-build.js`.  The new structure allows Ember CLI to pass
information into the function exported by `ember-cli-build.js` and avoid the issues mentioned above.

The migration from `Brocfile.js` to `ember-cli-build.js` is fairly straight forward:

Migrate `Brocfile.js` from:
```js
// Brocfile.js
var EmberApp = require('ember-cli/lib/broccoli/ember-app');
var app = new EmberApp();
module.exports = app.toTree();
```

To `ember-cli-build.js`:

```js
var EmberApp = require('ember-cli/lib/broccoli/ember-app');

module.exports = function(defaults) {
  var app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
      // Any options
  });

  return app.toTree();
};
```

### Deprecations Added in Ember CLI 2.2.0

#### Deprecate Utility

###### until: 3.0.0
###### id: cli.ui.deprecate

Using the `ember-cli/lib/utlities/deprecate` module to issue deprecations has been deprecated
in favor of using `.writeDeprecateLine` method on the `ui` object (which is available on both
addons and project instances).

Migrate from:

```js
const deprecate = require('ember-cli/lib/utilities/deprecate');

module.exports = {
  name: 'my-addon-name',

  someMethod() {
    deprecate('this thing is deprecated!');
  }
}
```

To:

```js
module.exports = {
  name: 'my-addon-name',

  someMethod() {
    this.ui.writeDeprecateLine('this thing is deprecated!');
  }
}
```

### Deprecations Added in Ember CLI 2.7.0

#### Base URL

###### until: 3.0.0
###### id: cli.baseURL

The usage of `baseURL` setting in `config/environments.js` has been deprecated in favor of using
an explicit `rootURL`. A detailed explanation of the problem and the migration path can be found in
[this blog post](/blog/2016/04/28/baseURL.html).

Migration for pre-2.7 applications is:

1. Update `config/environment.js` to remove reference to `baseURL` and update to `rootURL`.
2. Update `app/index.html` to add `{{rootURL}}` a the beginning of all assets that are loaded.
3. Update the `app/router.js` to pass `rootURL` to the subclass of `Ember.Router` being created.

More detailed descriptions of this migration can be found on the blog: [here](/blog/2016/04/28/baseURL.html)

### Deprecations Added in Ember CLI 2.12.0

#### Clobbering Addon#options

Clobbering `this.options` within an addon has been deprecated. If you would like to use `this.options`
for internal options within your addon, you must preserve the intitial options object that is present.

Instead of doing this:

```js
included() {
  this.options = { my-addons: { special: { options: 'here' } } };
}
```

You should do the following:

```js
included() {
  this.options = this.options || {};
  this.options['my-addons'] = { special: { options: 'here' } };
}
```
