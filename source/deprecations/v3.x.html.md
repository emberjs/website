## Deprecations Added in Ember 3.x

What follows is a list of deprecations introduced to Ember.js during the 3.x
cycle.

For more information on deprecations in Ember, see the [main deprecations page]
(/deprecations).

### Deprecations Added in 3.2

#### Use defineProperty to define computed properties

##### until: 3.5.0
##### id: ember-meta.descriptor-on-object

Although uncommon, it is possible to assign computed properties directly to
objects and have them be implicitly computed from eg `Ember.get`.  As part of
supporting ES5 getter computed properties, assigning computed properties
directly is deprecated.  You should replace these assignments with calls to
`defineProperty`.

For example, the following:

```javascript
let object = {};
object.key = Ember.computed(() => 'value');
Ember.get(object, 'key') === 'value';
```

Should be changed to:

```javascript
let object = {};
Ember.defineProperty(object, 'key', Ember.computed(() => 'value'));
Ember.get(object, 'key') === 'value';
```

### Deprecations Added in 3.1

#### Use notifyPropertyChange instead of propertyWillChange and propertyDidChange

##### until: 3.5.0
##### id: ember-metal.deprecate-propertyWillChange, ember-metal.deprecate-propertyDidChange

The private APIs `propertyWillChange` and `propertyDidChange` will be removed after the first
LTS of the 3.x cycle. You should remove any calls to `propertyWillChange` and replace any
calls to `propertyDidChange` with `notifyPropertyChange`. This applies to both the Ember global
version and the EmberObject method version.

For example, the following:

```javascript
Ember.propertyWillChange(object, 'someProperty');
doStuff(object);
Ember.propertyDidChange(object, 'someProperty');

object.propertyWillChange('someProperty');
doStuff(object);
object.propertyDidChange('someProperty');
```

Should be changed to:

```javascript
doStuff(object);
Ember.notifyPropertyChange(object, 'someProperty');

doStuff(object);
object.notifyPropertyChange('someProperty');
```

#### Getting the @each property

##### until: 3.5.0
##### id: ember-metal.getting-each

Calling `array.get('@each')` is deprecated. `@each` may only be used as dependency key.

#### Router#route

##### until: 3.5.0
##### id: ember-routing.route-router

The `Router#route` private API has been renamed to `Router#_route` to avoid colliding with user defined
properties or methods.
If you want access to the router, you are probably better served injecting the router service into
the route like this:

```javascript
import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';

export default Route.extend({
  router: service()
});
```
