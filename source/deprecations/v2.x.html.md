## Deprecations Added in Ember 2.x

What follows is a list of deprecations introduced to Ember.js during the 2.x
cycle.

For more information on deprecations in Ember, see the [main deprecations page]
(/deprecations).

### Deprecations Added in 2.1

#### Initializer Arity

###### until: 3.0.0
###### id: ember-application.app-initializer-initialize-arguments

In prior versions of Ember initializers have taken two arguments (generally labeled as
`container` and `application`). Starting with Ember 2.1 providing two arguments to an
`initializer` will trigger a deprecation.

The following initializer for Ember 2.0 will trigger a deprecation:

```javascript
export function initialize(container, application) {
  application.inject('route', 'service:session');
}

export default {
  name: 'inject-session',
  initialize: initialize
}
```

To clear the deprecation, remove the first argument (`container` in the above example):

```javascript
export function initialize(application) {
  application.inject('route', 'service:session');
}

export default {
  name: 'inject-session',
  initialize: initialize
}
```

In some cases an addon might need to support both versions of Ember with the same initializer,
one way to do this without triggering a deprecation would be the following (using the same
example as above):

```javascript
export function initialize() {
  let application = arguments[1] || arguments[0];
  application.inject('route', 'service:session');
}

export default {
  name: 'inject-session',
  initialize: initialize
}
```

#### Ember.Application#registry / Ember.ApplicationInstance#registry

##### until: 3.0.0
##### id: ember-application.app-instance-registry

When the container and registry were split, the registry was added to `Ember.Application` instances (provided to
initializers as the first argument in 2.1) and `Ember.ApplicationInstance` instances (provided to instance initializers
as the first argument). Unfortunately, this was done without making it clear that the `.registry` property on
`Ember.Application` instances was private. This lead quite a few addons and applications to directly use the registry.

During the 2.1 cycle a new feature (`ember-registry-container-reform`) was enabled to provide more
public API's to access the `registry` functionality (without exposing all of the private internals).

The following list can be used to migrate from `app.registry.*` usage to the new public API's:

* `app.registry.resolve` -> `app.resolveRegistration`
* `app.registry.register` -> `app.register`
* `app.registry.unregister` -> `app.unregister`
* `app.registry.has` -> `app.hasRegistration`
* `app.registry.option` -> `app.registerOption`
* `app.registry.options` -> `app.registerOptions`
* `app.registry.getOptions` -> `app.registeredOptions`
* `app.registry.optionsForType` -> `app.registerOptionsForType`
* `app.registry.getOptionsForType` -> `app.registeredOptionsForType`
* `app.registry.injection` -> `app.inject`

#### Ember.ApplicationInstance#container

##### until: 3.0.0
##### id: ember-application.app-instance-container

When instance initializers were added, using `appInstance.container.lookup` was suggested in lieu of using the first argument
to initializers. Unfortunately, the `container` system has always been private and the previous initializer deprecation led
users down the wrong path.

During the 2.1 cycle a new feature (`ember-registry-container-reform`) was enabled to provide more
public API's for accessing the container for looking up instances without exposing all of the private internals.

Please refactor from using `appInstance.container.lookup` to `appInstance.lookup`.

Before:

```javascript
// app/initializers/preload-store.js

export function initialize(appInstance) {
  let store = appInstance.container.lookup('service:store');

  store.pushPayload(`<payload here>`);
}

export default {
  name: 'preload-store',
  initialize: initialize
}
```

After:

```javascript
// app/instance-initializers/preload-store.js

export function initialize(appInstance) {
  let store = appInstance.lookup('service:store');

  store.pushPayload(`<payload here>`);
}

export default {
  name: 'preload-store',
  initialize: initialize
}
```

#### Ember debug function options

##### until: 3.0.0
##### id: ember-debug.deprecate-options-missing, ember-debug.deprecate-id-missing, ember-debug.deprecate-until-missing, ember-debug.warn-options-missing, ember-debug.warn-id-missing

Starting in Ember 2.1 various debug functions now require a third argument (commonly called `options`).

`id` is required by all methods listed below, and the deprecation related methods also require an `until` property.

* `Ember.deprecate`
* `Ember.deprecateFunc`
* `Ember.computed.deprecatingAlias`
* `Ember.warn`

The `id` property is intended to allow runtime debug handlers to uniquely identify the source, and the `until` property is used
to indicate the future version when the deprecated behavior will no longer exist.

The goal of these changes is to allow tools like
[ember-cli-deprecation-workflow](https://github.com/mixonic/ember-cli-deprecation-workflow) to make managing
these deprecations and warnings much easier (by matching on the `id` instead of the full deprecation/warn message).

#### Ember.Component#defaultLayout

##### until: 3.0.0
##### id: ember-views.component.defaultLayout

Specifying a `defaultLayout` to a component is deprecated in favor of specifying `layout` directly. `defaultLayout` was
often used in order to allow inheriting components to fallback to their parents `defaultLayout` if a custom `layout` was
not provided. Due to the way a components layout is looked up naturally, this is true when using `layout` properties in
both locations. Changing the `layout` detection process allows initial render speed (with many components) to be
improved pretty significantly.

Before:

```javascript
// Ember < 2.1
import layout from '../templates/some-thing-lol';

export default Ember.Component.extend({
  defaultLayout: layout
});
```

After:

```javascript
// Ember 2.1 and later
import layout from '../templates/some-thing-lol';

export default Ember.Component.extend({
  layout: layout
});
```

#### Ember.Component#currentState

##### until: 2.3.0
##### id: ember-view.current-state

The `currentState` property on `Ember.Component` instances is a private property that Ember uses
internally to deal with the various states a component can be in (in DOM, pre-render, destroying, etc). Unfortunately,
this removes a pretty common term (`currentState` might be used for many things in a user-land component).

In Ember 2.1 the internal `.currentState` property has been moved to `_currentState` to avoid conflicts.

Please keep in mind that `.currentState` / `._currentState` is still private and should not be used/relied upon
outside of Ember internals.

### Deprecations Added in 2.2

#### Function as test in Ember.deprecate, Ember.warn, Ember.assert

##### until: 2.5.0
##### id: ember-debug.deprecate-test-as-function
##### Deprecated behavior

Calling `Ember.deprecate`, `Ember.warn` or `Ember.assert` with a function as test argument is deprecated.

You can no longer pass arguments of type `function` to these methods. Following calls will trigger deprecations:

```javascript
const message = 'Test message.';
const options = { id: 'test', until: '3.0.0' };

// passing function
Ember.deprecate(message, function() {
  return true;
}, options);

const myConstructor = {}.constructor;

// passing constructor (also a function)
Ember.warn(message, myConstructor, options);

// passing function with double arrow syntax
Ember.assert(message, () => true, options);
```

[Demo.](http://ember-twiddle.com/34d36b9121e017d2388f)

##### Refactoring

You have 3 options to refactor second argument from `function` to `boolean`:

1. Use [IIFE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression).
2. Use `!!Constructor` for constructors.
3. Pass `boolean` directly instead of wrapping it in function.

Example:

``` javascript
// ... message, options omitted for brevity

// passing IIFE (1)
Ember.deprecate(message, (function() {
	return true;
})(), options);

const myConstructor = {}.constructor;

// passing !!constructor (2)
Ember.warn(message, !!myConstructor, options);

// passing boolean directly (3)
Ember.assert(message, true, options);
```

[Demo.](http://ember-twiddle.com/ed90d0c7812914f09a3f)

In a future version functions will be treated as truthy values instead of being executed.

### Deprecations added in 2.3

#### Injected container access

##### until: 3.0.0
##### id: ember-application.injected-container

`this.container` has been private API since at least Ember 1.0.0. Unfortunately, there was not a public API available
to use as an alternative.  In the Ember 2.1 cycle a number of public API's were added to instance initializers
that allowed access to the container and registry (see [here](http://emberjs.com/api/classes/ContainerProxyMixin.html)
and [here](http://emberjs.com/api/classes/RegistryProxyMixin.html) for details of the public API's), but this new public
API surface was not added to individual instances that were using `this.container` directly.

Ember 2.3 now provides a public API for usage from within any instances that were instantiated from the container.

Before:

```js
// Ember < 2.3
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Helper.extend({
  init() {
    this._super(...arguments);

    this.customThing = this.container.lookup('custom:thing');
  }
});
```

After:

```js
// Ember 2.3 and later
import Ember from 'ember';

const { getOwner } = Ember;

export default Ember.Helper.extend({
  init() {
    this._super(...arguments);

    this.customThing = getOwner(this).lookup('custom:thing');
  }
});
```

This refactor is relatively straight forward for applications, but still leaves a few gaps for addons that want to function
without deprecation on all versions while still using the newer paradigms. [ember-getowner-polyfill](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-getowner-polyfill)
was created for this exact reason.

Using the above before example, the following demonstrates how to use the polyfill:

```js
// Ember 2.3 and later
import Ember from 'ember';
import getOwner from 'ember-getowner-polyfill';

export default Ember.Helper.extend({
  init() {
    this._super(...arguments);

    this.customThing = getOwner(this).lookup('custom:thing');
  }
});
```

### Deprecations Added in 2.4

#### {{#render}} helper with block

##### until: 2.4.0
##### id: ember-template-compiler.deprecate-render-block

The `{{render}}` helper was never intended to support a block form, but unfortunatley (mostly
due to various refactorings in 1.10 and 1.13) it started working in block form. Since this was
not properly engineered, there are a number of caveats (i.e. the `controller` and `target` values of
anything inside the block are incorrect) that prevent continued support.

Support the following forms will be removed after 2.4:

```hbs
{{#render 'foo'}}
  <p>Stuff Here</p>
{{/render}}
```

```hbs
{{#render 'foo' someModel}}
  <p>Stuff Here</p>
{{/render}}
```

### Deprecations Added in 2.6

#### Ember.Component#didInitAttrs

##### until: 3.0.0
##### id: ember-views.did-init-attrs

Using `didInitAttrs` is deprecated in favour of using `init`. When `init` is called the attrs sent in with the component will be
available after calling `this._super(...arguments)`

Given a htmlbars template like this:

```hbs
{{my-component handle="@tomdale"}}
```

Before:

```js
export default Ember.Component.extend({
  didInitAttrs() {
    this._super(...arguments);
    this.get('handle'); // @tomdale
  }
});
```

After:

```js
export default Ember.Component.extend({
  init() {
    this._super(...arguments);
    this.get('handle'); // @tomdale
  }
});
```

#### Model param in `{{render` helper

##### until: 3.0.0
##### id: ember-template-compiler.deprecate-render-model

Using the model param in the `{{render` helper is deprecated in favor of using
components. Please refactor to a component and invoke thusly:

For example, if you had:

```hbs
{{render 'foo-bar' someModel}}
```

```hbs
{{! app/templates/foo-bar.hbs }}
<p>{{someProp}} template stuff here</p>
```

```js
// app/controllers/foo-bar.js
export default Controller.extend({
  someProp: Ember.computed('model.yolo', function() {
    return this.get('model.yolo');
  })
});
```

Would be refactored to:

```hbs
{{foo-bar model=someModel}}
```

```hbs
{{! app/templates/components/foo-bar.hbs }}
<p>{{someProp}} template stuff here</p>
```

```js
// app/components/foo-bar.js
export default Component.extend({
  someProp: Ember.computed('model.yolo', function() {
    return this.get('model.yolo');
  })
});
```

#### Legacy support addons

Ember provides addons [ember-legacy-views](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-legacy-views) and
[ember-legacy-controllers](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-legacy-controllers) that allow for projects to continue
using some legacy concepts in 2.x.
Beginning in 2.4, use of these addons is now deprecated.

See the deprecation guide sections on [removing views](http://emberjs.com/deprecations/v1.x/#toc_ember-view),
[`ArrayController`](http://emberjs.com/deprecations/v1.x/#toc_arraycontroller),
and [`ObjectController`](http://emberjs.com/deprecations/v1.x/#toc_objectcontroller)
for information on migration.

Once view and controller deprecations are removed, you can remove the addons with the command:
`npm uninstall --save-dev ember-legacy-views && npm uninstall ember-legacy-controllers`

### Deprecations Added in 2.7

#### Ember.Backburner

##### until: 2.8.0
##### id: ember-metal.ember-backburner

`Ember.Backburner` was private throughout the Ember 2.x series and will be
removed _after_ 2.8.

#### Ember.Binding

##### until: 3.0.0
##### id: ember-metal.binding

`Ember.Binding` has not been needed for some time and is deprecated in favor of
computed properties and services (depending on what you were binding to). It is
recommended that you take the following actions:

1. Refactor global bindings to services
2. Refactor `oneWay` bindings to `readOnly` computed properties
3. Refactor all other bindings to `alias` computed properties

The [guide on services]
(https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.5.0/applications/services/) is a good place
to start for creating and consuming services to replace your global bindings.
In general though, you will replace your global with a service and consume it
like this:

```js
export default Ember.Component.extend({
  // will load the service in file /app/services/cool-service.js
  coolService: Ember.inject.service()
});
```

This would replace a binding that may have looked like this:

```js
export default Ember.Component.extend({
  boringObjectBinding: 'MyApp.boringObject'
});
```

Refactoring local bindings to computed properties can be achieved with
less work:

If you had this:

```js
export default Ember.Component.extend({
  thingContainer: …,
  thingOneBinding: Ember.Binding.oneWay('thingContainer.thingOne'),
  thingTwoBinding: 'thingContainer.thingTwo'
});
```

You could change it to this:

```js
export default Ember.Component.extend({
  thingContainer: …,
  thingOne: Ember.computed.readOnly('thingContainer.thingOne'),
  thingTwo: Ember.computed.alias('thingContainer.thingTwo')
});
```

See the [guide on computed properties]
(https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.5.0/object-model/computed-properties/) for
further reading.

### Deprecations Added in 2.8

#### Use Ember.String.htmlSafe over Ember.Handlebars.SafeString

##### until: 3.0.0
##### id: ember-htmlbars.ember-handlebars-safestring

Creating safe strings. Before:

```js
import Ember from 'ember';
const { computed } = Ember;

export default Ember.Component.extend({
  myString: computed(function(){
    return new Ember.Handlebars.SafeString(someString);
  });
})
```

After:

```js
import Ember from 'ember';
const { computed } = Ember;

export default Ember.Component.extend({
  myString: computed(function(){
    return Ember.String.htmlSafe(someString);
  });
)};
```

Detecting safe strings. Before:

```js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Component.extend({
  actions: {
    save() {
      let myString = this.get('myString');
      if (myString instanceof Ember.Handlebars.SafeString) {
        // ...
      }
    }
  }
});
```

After:

```js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Component.extend({
  actions: {
    save() {
      let myString = this.get('myString');
      if (Ember.String.isHTMLSafe(myString)) {
        // ...
      }
    }
  }
});
```

If you're an addon maintainer, there is a polyfill for safe string detection ([ember-string-ishtmlsafe-polyfill](https://github.com/workmanw/ember-string-ishtmlsafe-polyfill))
that will help maintain backwards compatibility. Additionally, it's worth noting that `Ember.String.htmlSafe`
is supported back to pre-1.0, so there should be no concerns of backwards compatibility there.

#### Enumerable#contains

##### until: 3.0.0
##### id: ember-runtime.enumerable-contains

The `Enumerable#contains` and `Array#contains` methods were deprecated in favor of `Enumerable#includes` and `Array#includes`
to stay in line with ES standards. See [RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0136-contains-to-includes.md) for details.

`contains` and `includes` have similar behaviors. A notable exception is how `NaN` values are handled.
`contains` uses [Strict equality comparison algorithm](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/2016/#sec-strict-equality-comparison)
for testing inclusion while `includes` uses [SameValueZero algorithm](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/2016/#sec-samevaluezero).

Before:

```js
var arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', NaN, undefined, null];
arr.contains('b');        // true
arr.contains('d');        // false
arr.contains(NaN);        // false
arr.contains(null);       // false
arr.contains(undefined);  // false
```

After:

```js
var arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', NaN, undefined, null];
arr.includes('b');        // true
arr.includes('d');        // false
arr.includes(NaN);        // true
arr.includes(null);       // true
arr.includes(undefined);  // true
```

`includes` also allows a second optional parameter `startAt` to specify the index at which to begin searching:

```js
var arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', NaN];
arr.includes('c', 2);   // true
arr.includes('c', -2);  // true
```

Note that the second `startAt` parameter is only available for `Ember.Array` because `Ember.Enumerable` does not rely on index-ordered access.

`Enumerable#without` and `MutableEnumerable#addObject` use now internally `includes` instead of `contains`. This leads to some minor breaking changes:

Before:

```js
var arr = ['a', 'b'];

arr.addObject(NaN);       // ['a', 'b', NaN]
arr.addObject(NaN);       // ['a', 'b', NaN, NaN]
arr.without(NaN);         // ['a', 'b', NaN, NaN]
```

After:

```js
var arr = ['a', 'b'];

var arr = ['a', 'b'];

arr.addObject(NaN);       // ['a', 'b', NaN]
arr.addObject(NaN);       // ['a', 'b', NaN]
arr.without(NaN);         // ['a', 'b']
```


Added in [PR #13553](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/13553).

### Deprecations Added in Pending Features

#### Route#serialize

##### until: 3.0.0
##### id: ember-routing.serialize-function

The `Route#serialize` function was deprecated in favor of passing a `serialize` function into the route's definition in the router map. For more detailed information see the [Route Serializers RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0120-route-serializers.md).

As an example, given a route like:

```js
// app/routes/post.js
import Ember from 'ember';
export default Ember.Route.extend({
  // ...
  serialize(model) {
    return { post_id: model.id };
  }
});

// app/router.js
export default Router.map(function() {
  this.route('post', {
    path: '/post/:post_id'
  });
});
```

You would refactor it like so:

```js
// app/routes/post.js
import Ember from 'ember';
export default Ember.Route.extend({
  // ...
});

// app/router.js
function serializePostRoute(model) {
  return { post_id: model.id };
}

export default Router.map(function() {
  this.route('post', {
    path: '/post/:post_id',
    serialize: serializePostRoute
  });
});
```
