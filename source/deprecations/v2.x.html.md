## Deprecations Added in Ember 2.x

What follows is a list of deprecations introduced to Ember.js during the 2.x
cycle.

For more information on deprecations in Ember, see the [main deprecations page]
(/deprecations).

### Deprecations Added in 2.1

#### Initializer Arity

In prior versions of Ember initializers have taken two arguments (generally labeled as
`container` and `application`). Starting with Ember 2.1 providing two arguments to an
`initializer` will trigger a deprecation.

The following initializer for Ember 2.0 will trigger a deprecation:

```javascript
export function initialize(container, application) {
  application.inject('route', 'service:session');
}

export default {
  name: 'inject-session',
  initialize: initialize
}
```

To clear the deprecation, remove the first argument (`container` in the above example):

```javascript
export function initialize(application) {
  application.inject('route', 'service:session');
}

export default {
  name: 'inject-session',
  initialize: initialize
}
```

In some cases an addon might need to support both versions of Ember with the same initializer,
one way to do this without triggering a deprecation would be the following (using the same
example as above):

```javascript
export function initialize() {
  let application = arguments[1] || arguments[0];
  application.inject('route', 'service:session');
}

export default {
  name: 'inject-session',
  initialize: initialize
}
```

#### Ember.Application#registry / Ember.ApplicationInstance#registry

When the container and registry were split, the registry was added to `Ember.Application` instances (provided to
initializers as the first argument in 2.1) and `Ember.ApplicationInstance` instances (provided to instance initializers
as the first argument). Unfortunately, this was done without making it clear that the `.registry` property on
`Ember.Application` instances was private. This lead quite a few addons and applications to directly use the registry.

During the 2.1 cycle a new feature (`ember-registry-container-reform`) was enabled to provide more
public API's to access the `registry` functionality (without exposing all of the private internals).

The following list can be used to migrate from `app.registry.*` usage to the new public API's:

* `app.registry.resolve` -> `app.resolveRegistration`
* `app.registry.register` -> `app.register`
* `app.registry.unregister` -> `app.unregister`
* `app.registry.has` -> `app.hasRegistration`
* `app.registry.option` -> `app.registerOption`
* `app.registry.options` -> `app.registerOptions`
* `app.registry.getOptions` -> `app.registeredOptions`
* `app.registry.optionsForType` -> `app.registerOptionsForType`
* `app.registry.getOptionsForType` -> `app.registeredOptionsForType`
* `app.registry.injection` -> `app.inject`

#### Ember.ApplicationInstance#container

When instance initializers were added, using `appInstance.container.lookup` was suggested in lieu of using the first argument
to initializers. Unfortunately, the `container` system has always been private and the previous initializer deprecation led
users down the wrong path.

During the 2.1 cycle a new feature (`ember-registry-container-reform`) was enabled to provide more
public API's for accessing the container for looking up instances without exposing all of the private internals.

Please refactor from using `appInstance.container.lookup` to `appInstance.lookup`.

Before:

```javascript
// app/initializers/preload-store.js

export function initialize(appInstance) {
  let store = appInstance.container.lookup('service:store');

  store.pushPayload(`<payload here>`);
}

export default {
  name: 'preload-store',
  initialize: initialize
}
```

After:

```javascript
// app/instance-initializers/preload-store.js

export function initialize(appInstance) {
  let store = appInstance.lookup('service:store');

  store.pushPayload(`<payload here>`);
}

export default {
  name: 'preload-store',
  initialize: initialize
}
```

#### Ember debug function options

Starting in Ember 2.1 various debug functions now require a third argument (commonly called `options`).

`id` is required by all methods listed below, and the deprecation related methods also require an `until` property.

* `Ember.deprecate`
* `Ember.deprecateFunc`
* `Ember.computed.deprecatingAlias`
* `Ember.warn`

The `id` property is intended to allow runtime debug handlers to uniquely identify the source, and the `until` property is used
to indicate the future version when the deprecated behavior will no longer exist.

The goal of these changes is to allow tools like
[ember-cli-deprecation-workflow](https://github.com/mixonic/ember-cli-deprecation-workflow) to make managing
these deprecations and warnings much easier (by matching on the `id` instead of the full deprecation/warn message).

#### Ember.Component#defaultLayout

Specifying a `defaultLayout` to a component is deprecated in favor of specifying `layout` directly. `defaultLayout` was
often used in order to allow inheriting components to fallback to their parents `defaultLayout` if a custom `layout` was
not provided. Due to the way a components layout is looked up naturally, this is true when using `layout` properties in
both locations. Changing the `layout` detection process allows initial render speed (with many components) to be
improved pretty significantly.

Before:

```javascript
// Ember < 2.1
import layout from '../templates/some-thing-lol';

export default Ember.Component.extend({
  defaultLayout: layout
});
```

After:

```javascript
// Ember 2.1 and later
import layout from '../templates/some-thing-lol';

export default Ember.Component.extend({
  layout: layout
});
```

#### Ember.Component#currentState

The `currentState` property on `Ember.Component` instances is a private property that Ember uses
internally to deal with the various states a component can be in (in DOM, pre-render, destroying, etc). Unfortunately,
this removes a pretty common term (`currentState` might be used for many things in a user-land component).

In Ember 2.1 the internal `.currentState` property has been moved to `_currentState` to avoid conflicts.

Please keep in mind that `.currentState` / `._currentState` is still private and should not be used/relied upon
outside of Ember internals.

### Deprecations Added in 2.2

#### Function as test in Ember.deprecate, Ember.warn, Ember.assert

##### Deprecated behavior

Calling `Ember.deprecate`, `Ember.warn` or `Ember.assert` with a function as test argument is deprecated.

You can no longer pass arguments of type `function` to these methods. Following calls will trigger deprecations:

```javascript
const message = 'Test message.';
const options = { id: 'test', until: '3.0.0' };

// passing function
Ember.deprecate(message, function() {
  return true;
}, options);

const myConstructor = {}.constructor;

// passing constructor (also a function)
Ember.warn(message, myConstructor, options);

// passing function with double arrow syntax
Ember.assert(message, () => true, options);
```

[Demo.](http://ember-twiddle.com/34d36b9121e017d2388f)

##### Refactoring

You have 3 options to refactor second argument from `function` to `boolean`:

1. Use [IIFE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression).
2. Use `!!Constructor` for constructors.
3. Pass `boolean` directly instead of wrapping it in function.

Example:

``` javascript
// ... message, options ommited for brevity

// passing IIFE (1)
Ember.deprecate(message, (function() {
	return true;
})(), options);

const myConstructor = {}.constructor;

// passing !!constructor (2)
Ember.warn(message, !!myConstructor, options);

// passing boolean directly (3)
Ember.assert(message, true, options);
```

[Demo.](http://ember-twiddle.com/ed90d0c7812914f09a3f)

In a future version functions will be treated as truthy values instead of being executed.

### Deprecations added in 2.3

#### Injected container access

`this.container` has been private API since at least Ember 1.0.0. Unfortunately, there was not a public API available
to use as an alternative.  In the Ember 2.1 cycle a number of public API's were added to instance initializers
that allowed access to the container and registry (see [here](http://emberjs.com/api/classes/ContainerProxyMixin.html)
and [here](http://emberjs.com/api/classes/RegistryProxyMixin.html) for details of the public API's), but this new public
API surface was not added to individual instances that were using `this.container` directly.

Ember 2.3 now provides a public API for usage from within any instances that were instantiated from the container.

Before:

```js
// Ember < 2.3
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Helper.extend({
  init() {
    this._super(...arguments);

    this.customThing = this.container.lookup('custom:thing');
  }
});
```

After:

```js
// Ember 2.3 and later
import Ember from 'ember';

const { getOwner } = Ember;

export default Ember.Helper.extend({
  init() {
    this._super(...arguments);

    this.customThing = getOwner(this).lookup('custom:thing');
  }
});
```

This refactor is relatively straight forward for applications, but still leaves a few gaps for addons that want to function
without deprecation on all versions while still using the newer paradigms. [ember-getowner-polyfill](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-getowner-polyfill)
was created for this exact reason.

Using the above before example, the following demonstrates how to use the polyfill:

```js
// Ember 2.3 and later
import Ember from 'ember';
import getOwner from 'ember-getowner-polyfill';

export default Ember.Helper.extend({
  init() {
    this._super(...arguments);

    this.customThing = getOwner(this).lookup('custom:thing');
  }
});
```
