## Deprecations

Periodically, various APIs in Ember.js may be deprecated. During a minor
release, for instance when upgrading from version 1.9 to 1.10, you may see new
deprecations fire in your codebase. Until a major revision such as 2.0 lands,
code firing such deprecations is still supported by the Ember community. After
the next major revision lands, the supporting code may be removed. This style
of change management is commonly referred to as [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
