  <img src="/images/community/bug.png">

  <p>If you've found a bug or issue in Ember.js, please let us know. To file a bug, go to the
    <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues">issue tracker</a> and create a new
    issue. Great bug reports include a clear description of what is not happening and what
    you expected to happen. Issues that include a failing test or a reduced test case
    created on <a href="http://jsfiddle.net">JSFiddle</a> or
    <a href="http://jsbin.com">JSBin</a> are much more likely to receive attention.

  <h2>Meetups Around the World</h2>

  <img src="/images/community/meetup.png">

  <p>There are a number of different Ember.js meetups around the world.
    Going to a meetup is a great way to learn more about Ember.js and meet
    other developers.</p>

  <table class="columns">
    <tr>
      <% data.meetups.each do |name, groups| %>
        <td>
          <h3><%= name %></h3>

            <% groups.sort_by(&:location).each do |group| %>
              <li><%= link_to group.location, group.url %></li>

  <h2>Looking to Learn? Videos n' More!</h2>

  <img src="/images/community/campster.png">

  <p>Ember is a new and growing community, and we're working to create learning resources as fast as we can.
  Here are some useful places to look for content other than our documentation:</p>
    <ul class="inline_list">
      <li><a href="https://addepar.com/ember/">Videos from the First Ever EmberCamp</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://emberwatch.com/">EmberWatch</a>, a great aggregator of Ember-related content</li>
      <li><a href="http://ember101.com/">Ember101.com</a>, a new screencast site devoted to Ember</li>
      <li><a href="https://peepcode.com/products/emberjs">Fire Up Ember.js Peepcode</a>; it's not free, but it is good</li>
      <li><a href="http://emberweekly.com/">Ember Weekly</a>, an Ember newsletter delivered to your inbox.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>...and lastly, there are screencasts and videos sprinkled throughout the docs.</p>
