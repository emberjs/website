  <p>If you've found a bug or issue in Ember.js, please let us know. To file a bug, go to the
    <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues">issue tracker</a> and create a new
    issue. Great bug reports include a clear description of what is not happening and what
    you expected to happen. Issues that include a failing test or a reduced test case
    created on <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/6p6XJ/">JSFiddle</a> or
    <a href="http://jsbin.com">JSBin</a> are much more likely to receive attention.
