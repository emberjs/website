<h1>Ember Logos</h1>

<p>
  Ember速, the Ember速 logo design and the Tomster速 designs are exclusive trademarks registered in the United States by Tilde Inc.
</p>

<p>
  The Ember brand and associated assets are all part of a carefully curated experience.
  We take great pride in what our team and community have helped bring to life.
</p>

<h2>The Assets</h2>

<p>
  The Ember logo is an official project resource that can be used on websites, mobile apps, or in printed materials to indicate use of Ember technologies&mdash;<strong>assuming there is no chance it might imply official status or project/core team endorsement</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  It may not be manipulated in any way, may <strong>never</strong> be incorporated into other logos, and is best displayed on a black or very light colored background. The 速 symbol must be present.
</p>

<p>
  The Ember project has numerous projects under the Ember umbrella. These other logos may be used under the same terms as the primary Ember logo.
</p>

<p>
  If you use the logo, please add standard language explicitly indicating unofficial status. For example, "This page/product/etc is unaffiliated with the Ember project. Ember is a trademark of Tilde Inc."

<h2>The Ember Mascot: The Tomster</h2>

<p>The Ember Tomster is reserved for official Ember project use <em>only</em>.</p>
<p>
  We sometimes grant licenses for specific use cases, and certain community initiatives may, with approval, commission the design of custom Tomsters via official channels. For more info on commissioned Tomsters, <a href="../tomster/faq">visit the Tomster FAQ page</a>.
</p>

<h2>Naming</h2>

<p>
  Please avoid naming your projects and events anything that implies Ember or Tilde's endorsement. Keep this in mind when selecting domain names as well.
</p>
<p>
  It is alright to use Ember in the name of local meetup groups, which are well understood to be unofficial. It is also alright to use Ember in the name of other events, assuming the official Ember logo is never made part of the name/logo for the unofficial event.
</p>
<p>
  EmberConf and EmberCamp are both used for official purposes and cannot otherwise be used.
