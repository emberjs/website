## [Lets Send SendAction Away!](#lets-send-send-action-away)
The time has come. `component#sendAction` has served the Ember community well for years but in a new [RFC by @cibernox](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/335) he proposes to deprecate this feature. In the old days, before v1.13, `component#sendAction` was the only way to bubble up actions from components. Since v1.13 we have _closure actions_ which are more intuitive and flexible and they are the current recommended Ember Wayâ„¢ for doing actions in components.

_Closure actions_ have been the recommended way to do actions in components for almost 3 years. Also `component#sendAction` is not even mentioned in the guides anymore so there is really little reason to keep it around. So look out for a new deprecation near you, coming soon!

If you want to learn more about why _closure actions_ are preferred over `component#sendAction` then you can check out [this blog post from 2016](http://miguelcamba.com/blog/2016/01/24/ember-closure-actions-in-depth).
