What an incredible time to be in the Ember Community! 

- Ember.js completed seven backward-compatible minor version releases in the last year.
- An amazing 200+ community members contributed to core Ember projects (that's not even counting the 4500+ ember addons!)
- Over 3,000 community members have joined the [Ember Discord chat](https://discord.gg/emberjs).
- An [Ember documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cvz-9ccflKQ) was released, looking at Ember's history...and Ember's bright future.

With 2019 already under way, we would like your help to learn about who is in the Ember community and how they work with the framework. To that end, we're pleased to announce the official 2019 Ember Community Survey.

This is the fifth year we're learning about the community's makeup and interests, and we look forward to sharing the results at [EmberConf 2019](http://emberconf.com/) on March 18th. Over 1300 participants took part in the survey in 2018 ([2018 survey results](https://www.emberjs.com/ember-community-survey-2018/)) and we are aiming for even more participation this year!

Completing the survey should take about 15 minutes. We've added a few new questions this year, while retaining opportunities to share feedback as free-form text. All submissions are completely anonymous, and demographic data about the community is not released in the same raw data files as the free-form text and other answers.

Submissions will be accepted until March 12th.

Please help us spread the word by sharing the [survey landing page](/ember-community-survey-2019) on your social network feeds, at meetups and around your office and other communities.

We look forward to your participation! If you have any immediate questions, feel free to email the survey team via [survey@emberjscommunity.com](mailto:survey@emberjscommunity.com), or ping us in #dev-ember-learning in Discord chat.
