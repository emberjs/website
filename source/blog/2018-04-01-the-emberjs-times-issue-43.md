## [The Road Ahead for Ember CLI in 2018](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/ember-cli-2018-edition/14543)

This week the Ember CLI team has published their *official roadmap* for the
command-line tool to keep the Ember community posted on which shiny new things
might be landing in an Ember app near you soon.

The current project goals for 2018 include a dedicated migration story to
[Module Unification](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/143), enabling
[Treeshaking](https://github.com/ember-cli/rfcs/pull/110), adding service worker support
to the blueprint of Ember apps by default and many other exciting topics.

You can read more about the roadmap on the [Ember Forum](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/ember-cli-2018-edition/14543)
and give your thoughts and suggestions in the discussion.

  <p>
    With Ember 3.1 you now get ES5 getters for computed properties since our target browsers support ES5 getters. The motivation is to improve developer ergonomics and interoperability with other tooling and libraries. For the property to recompute you still need to use this.set() or Ember.set().</p>
  <p>
    Yet, this doesn‚Äôt mean that this.get() is now deprecated. There‚Äôs actually still a lot of cases where you should use this.get() instead of the ES5 getter. 
    You can read all about it in the <a href="https://www.emberjs.com/blog/2018/04/13/ember-3-1-released.html#toc_es5-getters-for-computed-properties-1-of-3">release post</a>.
