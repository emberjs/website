title: Ember 3.2 and 3.3 Beta Released
author: Ricardo Mendes
tags: Releases
---

Today the Ember project is releasing version 3.2.0 of Ember.js, Ember Data, and Ember CLI.

This release kicks off the 3.3 beta cycle for all sub-projects. We encourage our
community (especially addon authors) to help test these beta builds and report
any bugs before they are published as a final release in six weeks' time. The
[ember-try](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try) addon is a great way to
continuously test your projects against the latest Ember releases.

### Changes in Ember.js 3.2

Ember.js 3.2 is an incremental, backwards compatible release of Ember with
bugfixes, performance improvements, and minor deprecations.

#### Deprecations in Ember 3.2

Deprecations are added to Ember.js when an API will be removed at a later date.

Each deprecation has an entry in the deprecation guide describing the migration
path to more stable API. Deprecated public APIs are not removed until a major
release of the framework.
