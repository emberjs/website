Ember Data 2.2 beta.1, the branch of Ember Data that will be released as stable in roughly six weeks, is also being released today.

## New Features in Ember Data 2.1

There are no new Features introduced in Ember Data 2.1. Instead the
Ember Data team spent this release cycle focused on improving the
guides, API documentation and fixing bugs.

## Ember Data 2.2 beta

No new features are currently planned for Ember Data 2.2. During the
canary cycle leading to this beta, the Ember Data team and community
have been primarily focused on bug fixes and performance
improvements. The Ember Data team expects the introduction of new
features to resume in Ember Data 2.3.
