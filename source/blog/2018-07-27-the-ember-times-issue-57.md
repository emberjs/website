## [Pointy single word components available üëà](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-angle-bracket-invocation-polyfill)

Since last Monday single word component names are now possible with the **angle bracket invocation syntax**. Invoking components via angle brackets was already available, the novelty is that you can now use this syntax with single word components as well.

For example, the polyfill supports components names such as `<Button>`, `<Modal>` and `<Tab>`.

To find out more, check out the relevant RFC section [here](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0311-angle-bracket-invocation.md#tag-name).

## [Readers' Questions: "What's the difference between ember-lifeline and ember-concurrency and which one should be used?" ü§î](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/readers-questions-whats-the-difference-between-ember-lifeline-and-ember-concurrency-and-which-one-should-be-used/15197)

<div class="blog-row">
  <img class="float-right small transparent padded" alt="Office Hours Tomster Mascot" title="Readers' Questions" src="/images/tomsters/officehours.png" />

  <p>This week's Readers' Question operates <strong>asynchronously</strong>: Both <code>ember-concurrency</code> and
  <code>ember-lifeline</code> are popular addons for managing async behaviour in your Ember applications
  as smoothly as possible. But what's the <strong>difference</strong> between those two?

   <p>In his detailed answer to this question, Ember developer and writer <a href="https://github.com/chrisrng" target="githubchris">@chrisrng</a> presents the <strong>strengths of either addon</strong> to handle application state. You can <a href="https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/readers-questions-whats-the-difference-between-ember-lifeline-and-ember-concurrency-and-which-one-should-be-used/15197" target="rq3">read the full answer on the official Ember Forum</a>.</p>
  <p>
</div>

Wondering about something related to Ember, Ember Data, Glimmer, or addons in the Ember ecosystem? Ask away at [bit.ly/ask-ember-core](https://bit.ly/ask-ember-core) and we'll present the answer in a future Ember Times. There are no silly questions! üêπ
