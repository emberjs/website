The last year has been a wonderful time to work with the web, and a thrilling one to
be building applications with Ember.

- Ember.js completed seven backward-compatible minor version releases in the
  last year: 2.12 through 2.18.
  Included were three Long-Term Support (LTS) releases.
  Version 2.18 was declared as an LTS and is the final release of the project's 2.x series.
- Ember 3.0 and 3.1 beta versions also came into existence, marking the beginning of the [3.x
  series](http://emberjs.com/blog/tags/releases.html).
  3.0 removes public API deprecated in Ember 2.x releases.
- [Ember FastBoot](https://www.ember-fastboot.com/), a server-side rendering solution for Ember apps, reached 1.0.
- The Glimmer VM,
Ember's rendering system, also experienced a lot progress. This includes
implementations of `<Capital />`-style component syntax, compiled binary
byte-code, incremental rendering, and SSR with incremental rehydration. The [October Glimmer Progress Report](https://emberjs.com/blog/2017/10/10/glimmer-progress-report.html) is a good place to look for details.
- The [Ember.js addon community](https://www.emberaddons.com/) grew from 3500
  to almost 4500 publicly available addons!

With 2018 already under way, we would like your help to learn
about who is in the Ember community and how they work with the framework.
To that end, we're pleased to announce the official 2018 Ember Community Survey.

This is our fourth year learning about the community's makeup and interests,
and we're looking forward to
sharing the results at [EmberConf 2018](http://emberconf.com/) on March 13th.
A vast number of people, nearly 1600 participants, took part in the survey in 2017 ([2017 survey results](https://www.emberjs.com/ember-community-survey-2017/))

Completing the survey should take about 11 minutes. We've shortened the
survey compared to last year, and created opportunities for you to share
feedback as free-form text. All submissions are completely anonymous, and
demographic data about the community is not released in the same raw data files
as the free-form text and other answers.

Submissions will be accepted until March 7th.

Please help us spread the word by sharing the
[survey landing page](/ember-community-survey-2018) on your social
network feeds, at meetups and around your office and other communities.

We look forward to your participation!
