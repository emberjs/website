## [JSConf EU CFP is Now Open! 👐](https://2019.jsconf.eu/call-for-speakers/)

[JSConf EU](https://2019.jsconf.eu/), which will be held from **June 1 – 2 2019 in Berlin**, has officially opened their call for papers for a talk regarding JavaScript, the web, or a clever hack.

<!--alex ignore blind-->
This is a good opportunity for us, as Ember developers, to **showcase our work to the greater JavaScript community**. Similar to the [EmberConf process](https://www.emberjs.com/blog/2018/10/12/the-ember-times-issue-68.html#toc_a-href-https-emberconf-com-become-a-speaker-html-emberconf-2019-call-for-papers-a), the papers starts out blind and later gets de-anonymized.

The call for speakers this year is **open until December 23rd**. JSConf’s sibling conference, CSSconf, even published a blog on [How to write a great talk proposal for a tech conference](https://blog.cssconf.eu/2014/06/12/how-to-write-a-great-talk-proposal-for-a-tech-conference/).

_”Pick the topic you feel most passionate about. This is your conference.”_  is the JSConf EU saying so [apply to be a speaker](https://2019.jsconf.eu/call-for-speakers/) today!

## [Yo Dawg, I Heard You Like RFCs](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/300)
There has been an update to the RFC about the RFC process itself. The RFCs has been crucial in defining **the future of Ember** and that is still the case.
However, in the process of reading and merging all of these RFCs, the Core Team has discovered some shortcomings of the current RFC process as well as new requirements.

To solve some of these issues, the RFC proposes that new RFCs are assigned a **Core Champion** from the Core Team as well as merging [ember-cli/rfcs](https://github.com/ember-cli/rfcs) into [emberjs/rfcs](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs).

There are more proposed solutions in [the RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/rfc-process-update/text/0300-rfc-process-update.md), which we recommend you read through and leave a comment with your thoughts.

## [Personalize Your Route's Metadata with the RouteInfo Metadata RFC 📝](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/398)

Have you ever wanted to **track** specific keywords for a particular route in your Ember app, but didn't know how to do so in an elegant fashion? Have you tried to update the `document.title` of a page depending on the specific point of time at which a route was visited, but realized that this couldn't be done without some effort?

Then a brand-new **Request for Comments (RFC)** is just for you! The proposal [_RouteInfo Metadata_](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/398) suggests a new way for reading and writing **application-specific metadata** to the corresponding _RouteInfo_ object. For more context on which information routes currently provide, be sure to also check out [the section about the RouteInfo type from the original RouterService RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0095-router-service.md#routeinfo-type).

And finally, read the full _RouteInfo Metadata_ proposal to learn more and leave your thoughts and questions in the [comments below the proposal](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/398).

## [Premier League Video Tutorial ⚽️](https://twitter.com/gavinjoyce/status/1059533557130059779)

[@GavinJoyce](https://github.com/gavinjoyce) made an awesome [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&v=vYakop2d2RI) where he walks through how to build a live updating league table in the **latest Ember 3.5**! Code along with the video and you'll use [ember-cli-tailwind](https://github.com/embermap/ember-cli-tailwind) for styling, angle bracket components, `shuffle` from [ember-composable-helpers](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-composable-helpers) (TIL), [ember-math-helpers](https://github.com/shipshapecode/ember-math-helpers) and more.

Check out [ember-league-table.surge.sh](ember-league-table.surge.sh) to run the app and the [repo](https://github.com/GavinJoyce/ember-league-table) for the source code. Our advice? Share the tutorial with a friend, whether they call it football or soccer...
