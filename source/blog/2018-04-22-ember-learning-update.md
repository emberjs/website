In order to keep the community updated while we move initiatives forward, we'd like to share with you the major outcomes from our face to face meeting that took place right after EmberConf 2018.

## Goals

We had a few goals for the day:

- craft a mission statement
- identify all of the initiatives that were in the scope of the learning team
- put all of the initiatives into categories
- prioritize the categories

We were able to identify categories of work that naturally fell in to one of two directions - user support and marketing. Here are some of of those categories, with initiatives for each:

### User Support

- Guides
- API Docs (version support, modules API, Broccoli)
- Tutorials (101 Quickstart, 201 Contacts, 301 Super Rentals)
- Infrastructure (subdomains, Ember-izing the website)
- Internal Evangelism (office hours, mentoring, simply contribution process)
- Tooling and Maintenance (Inspector, Language Servers, Twiddle)

### Marketing

- Website (devsign, upgrades & maintenance)
- External Evangelism (tech group outreach, podcast & blog collaboration)
- Traditional Marketing (Blog, Ember Doctrine, Why Ember, Testimonials)

There's more to this list, but we hope to give you a good idea of the direction where we are trying to go- and where every Ember user can help along the way!
