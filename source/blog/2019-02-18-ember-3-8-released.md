Today the Ember project is releasing version 3.8 of Ember.js, Ember Data, and Ember CLI. This release kicks off the 3.8 beta cycle for all sub-projects. We encourage our community (especially addon authors) to help test these beta builds and report any bugs before they are published as a final release in six weeks' time. The [ember-try](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try) addon is a great way to continuously test your projects against the latest Ember releases.

## Ember.js

Ember.js is the core framework for building ambitious web applications.

### Changes in Ember.js 3.8
Ember.js 3.8 is an incremental, backwards compatible release of Ember with bugfixes, performance improvements, and minor deprecations. There is two (2) new feature, COUNT (#) deprecations, and COUNT (#) bugfixes in this version.

#### New Features (2)

Element Modifier Manager (1 of 2)

A modifier manager is an object that is responsible for coordinating the lifecycle events that occurs when invoking, installing and updating an element modifier. This new feature is introduced as a  very low-level API. Most likely you will never - as an Ember app developer - need to use this but it might come in handy for some add-on developers. In this way, the Ember app developers will benefit from this feature by subclassing these special modifiers provided by addons.

If you're interested in learning more about how to use this new feature, then please refer to the [RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0373-Element-Modifier-Managers.md).

Second new feature (2 of 2)


#### Deprecations (0)

Deprecations are added to Ember.js when an API will be removed at a later date. Each deprecation has an entry in the deprecation guide describing the migration path to a more stable API. Deprecated public APIs are not removed until a major release of the framework.

Consider using the [ember-cli-deprecation-workflow](https://github.com/mixonic/ember-cli-deprecation-workflow) addon if you would like to upgrade your application without immediately addressing deprecations.

For more details on changes in Ember.js 3.8, please review the [Ember.js 3.8.0 release page](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/releases/tag/v3.8.0).

## Ember Data

Ember Data is the official data persistence library for Ember.js applications.

### Changes in Ember Data 3.8

#### New Features (0)

No new features introduced in Ember Data 3.8.

#### Deprecations (0)

No new deprecations introduced in Ember Data 3.8.


For more details on changes in Ember Data 3.8, please review the
[Ember Data 3.8.0 release page](https://github.com/emberjs/data/releases/tag/v3.8.0).

## Ember CLI

Ember CLI is the command line interface for managing and packaging Ember.js applications.

### Upgrading Ember CLI

You may upgrade Ember CLI easily using the ember-cli-update project:

```bash
npm install -g ember-cli-update
ember-cli-update
```

This utility will help you to update your app or add-on to the latest Ember CLI version. You will probably encounter merge conflicts, in which the default behavior is to let you resolve conflicts on your own. For more information on the `ember-cli-update` project, see [the github README](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-update).

While it is recommended to keep Ember CLI versions in sync with Ember and Ember Data, this is not required. After updating ember-cli, you can keep your current version(s) of Ember or Ember Data by editing `package.json` to revert the changes to the lines containing `ember-source` and `ember-data`.
