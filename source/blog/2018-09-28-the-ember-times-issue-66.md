## [The Addon Test Is Right Where It Belongs ❤️](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/378)

<!--alex ignore host-hostess-->
Spending too much time looking for the **test files** of your **in-repo addon**? Feeling too exhausted to maintain a large test suite in which addon and host app test cases are meshed together? It doesn't have to be this way.

Read more about how **collocated in-repo test files** are able to make your developer life easier in [this **shiny, new Request for Comments (RFC)**](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/378). And as always, be sure to **leave your questions or ❤️ emojis** right below the RFC's pull request description! ✨

## [ember-cli-deprecation-workflow 1.0.0 Release 🎉](https://twitter.com/rwjblue/status/1045031033274605575)

This week, [@rwjblue](https://github.com/rwjblue) (with help from [@mixonic](https://github.com/mixonic), [@atsao](https://github.com/atsao), and [@gaurav0](https://github.com/Gaurav0)) released [**1.0.0 of ember-cli-deprecation-workflow**](https://github.com/mixonic/ember-cli-deprecation-workflow/releases/tag/v1.0.0)!

[ember-cli-deprecation-workflow](https://github.com/mixonic/ember-cli-deprecation-workflow) is an addon geared towards making Ember upgrades easier by allowing you to work through deprecations without massive console noise from Ember 1.x and 2.x deprecations.

It silences the `console.log` noise or "deprecation spew" via configuration so that **only unhandled deprecations** will be **displayed in your console**. And now that the spew has settled down, you can process one deprecation at a time while ensuring that no new deprecations are introduced.

Check it out on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mixonic/ember-cli-deprecation-workflow)!

## [And Today's Special on The Router Menu: Query Params 👨‍🍳](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/380)

Ever had the need to read **query params (QPs)** off a `Controller` and pass it down to a component to change its UI state depending on the QP value?

Ever had a hard time passing down QP values through layers and layers of components to do just that?

It doesn't have to be this way. Read [this new RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/380) about exposing QPs as a _computed property_ on the `RouterService`. It proposes that this `Service` can then be injected into components easily which makes laborious passing of QP data obsolete.

As always, **leave your comments** and appreciation [below the original proposal](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/380) as long as it's **still under discussion**!

## [The Missing Docs Has Returned 📃](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/17002)
There has been [some documentation missing](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16993) from the Ember API docs from the release of 3.3 to 3.4. [@Gaurav0](https://github.com/Gaurav0) has done some great detective work 🕵  and [fixed these issues](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/17002) which means that **the missing documentation is now back.**

Going forward the plan is to provide better testing for cases like this so you always have access to the documentation you need.

## [Project Structure for Single Page Apps 📂](https://dev.to/nullvoxpopuli/a-general-and-flexible-file-structure-that-works-for-all-projects-in-any-ecosystem-1lp9)

Inspired by **Module Unification**, [@NullVoxPopuli](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli) has
written an article on **general project structure for single page apps.**
In the article he explains how structure is not specific to Ember, React, Vue, or anything else,
but just needs to meet a set of guidelines for some common desired goals.

Read it here: [_A general and flexible file structure that works for all projects in any ecosystem_](https://dev.to/nullvoxpopuli/a-general-and-flexible-file-structure-that-works-for-all-projects-in-any-ecosystem-1lp9)

## [Issue Triage 🕵️](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Ember.js-Issue-Triage--ANXsBgi3NQNstI7fSMQIONfOAg-Bh6AEHTj1Bt4rXq0Awg4R)

<p>
  This week we had <strong>5 volunteers</strong> helping 🚑 &nbsp;<strong>triage old issues</strong> that were inactive,
  we closed 9 and labelled 31 of 50 from last week that need a submitter response 🙀.
  Those 31 may be closed in the next week or two. Together, we addressed 17 issues
  that were inactive (and are still open 📂). We are beginning to establish a cadence
  again of a team addressing issue triage 🛠️ on Friday mornings.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks for your

  The <em>@emberjs/issues-team</em> objective is to <strong>increase signal-to-noise ratio of issues</strong>
  and 🐛 &nbsp;bugs so that the core team (and contributors) can take action to resolve bugs,
  and spend less effort sorting the issues queue. Currently there are about 67 open bugs, of
  those 25 had a reproduction (e.g. using <a href="https://ember-twiddle.com">ember-twiddle.com</a>), and one with a pull request - total count about 270. Our aim is to get down to 150 in the next
  couple months. If you'd like to <strong>help</strong> see the
