## [Issue Triage 🕵️](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Ember.js-Issue-Triage--ANXsBgi3NQNstI7fSMQIONfOAg-Bh6AEHTj1Bt4rXq0Awg4R)

<p>
  This week we had 5 volunteers helping 🚑 &nbsp;triage old issues that were inactive,
  we closed 9 and labelled 31 of 50 from last week that need a submitter response 🙀.
  Those 31 may be closed in the next week or two. Together, we addressed 17 issues
  that were inactive (and are still open 📂). We are beginning to establish a cadence
  again of a team addressing issue triage 🛠️ on Friday mornings.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks for your

  The <em>@emberjs/issues-team</em> objective is to increase signal-to-noise ratio of issues
  and 🐛 &nbsp;bugs so that the core team (and contributors) can take action to resolve bugs,
  and spend less effort sorting the issues queue. Currently there are about 67 open bugs, of
  those 25 had a reproduction (e.g. using <a href="https://ember-twiddle.com">ember-twiddle.com</a>)
  , and 1 with a pull request - total count about 270. Our aim is to get down to 150 in the next
  couple months. If you'd like to help see the
