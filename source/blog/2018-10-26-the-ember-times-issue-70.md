## ## [ember-i18n Deprecation and Release of ember-intl üåê](https://twitter.com/MiguelCamba/status/1054699605865177089)

[@snewcomer](https://github.com/snewcomer) and [@cibernox](https://github.com/cibernox) [announced](https://twitter.com/MiguelCamba/status/1054699605865177089) a new way to internationalize Ember apps, [ember-i18n](https://github.com/jamesarosen/ember-i18n) is now deprecated in favour of [ember-intl](https://github.com/ember-intl/ember-intl)! This will provide Ember with a standard package for internationalization.

There are [many reasons](https://twitter.com/MiguelCamba/status/1054720978478084097) to make the change such as:
- Using the [**ICU message format**](https://formatjs.io/guides/message-syntax/) which is a standard in the i18n industry
- **Locale-aware** numbers, dates, times, currencies, decimals, and percentages!
- Uses the [**Native Intl API**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl)
- Translations are way more powerful and **can contain logic** (like gender-dependent translations)
- Advanced [**addon support**](https://github.com/ember-intl/ember-intl/blob/master/docs/addon-support.md) to provide translations to the host app

There is even a [codemod](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-i18n-to-intl-migrator) to make the switch from ember-i18n to ember-intl easier! So [check it out](https://github.com/ember-intl/ember-intl) and make the switch today!
