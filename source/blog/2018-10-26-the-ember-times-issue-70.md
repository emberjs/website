## [Route Me Through Space üõ∞ and Time üï∞ with the Router Helpers RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/391)

Inspired by the [experimental addon ember-router-helpers](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-router-helpers) a [**new RFC (Request for Comments)**](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/391) illustrates a possible, new way to **route** through your Ember apps.

Several **new template helpers and element modifiers** for routing are proposed: This includes a `transition-to` element modifier for easy route-to-route transitions [surpassing some of the drawbacks](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/new-router-helpers/text/0000-router-helpers.md#motivation) of the functionally similar `link-to` helper. But also the design of and the motivation behind new, useful helpers like `root-url`, `is-active` and `is-loading` among others are explained in great detail in the RFC itself.

Curious? Be sure to give the [proposal a read and let your thoughts known in the comments below!](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/391)

## [Original & Artisan ‚òïÔ∏è Deprecations RFC for the setComponentManager API](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/392)

The üî• brand-new **Custom Component Manager API** üöí [has been shipped with Ember 3.4](https://emberjs.com/blog/2018/10/07/ember-3-4-released.html#toc_changes-in-ember-js-3-4) and is now - as a low-level API granting addon authors more freedom to create **components from customized base classes**.

This week a [freshly brewed RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/392) with its first, important deprecation rolled in: The proposal suggests to replace the **string-based lookup** method for the `setComponentManager` function for a **factory-based** approach. This small change in the API provides quick wins üèÖ for future undertakings regarding tree shaking of Ember apps, module unification and more.

Read all about the motivation behind this deprecation in the [hand-crafted RFC on Github](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/392).
