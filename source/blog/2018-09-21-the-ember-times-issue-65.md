Ahoj Emberistas! 🐹

In this week's edition we're sharing news about a fresh 🥒  RFC to deprecate `.property()`, exciting addon updates 🚀 for sparkles-component and ember-css-modules, and how Ember is a modern framework 🎉 - tell your friends! 

---

## [Deprecate All the Property 🏠 Modifiers ](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/375)

Remember `.property()`?

```js
fullName: computed(function() {
  // ...
}).property('firstName', 'lastName'),
```

This **modifier** for **computed properties** in Ember has been around for quite a while.
And even though computed properties have already allowed to pass in dependent keys as an argument directly, e.g....

```js
fullName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', function() {
  // ...
}),
```

...the modifier hasn't been deprecated yet. The main obstacle for the deprecation has been
the one valid use of `.property()`: It is required for cp macros, such as `filter` or `map` which receive a callback function as their argument.

A **brand-new 🔥 Request for Comments (RFC)** 🚒 proposes to transition away from the usage of `.property` for these macros to allow the deprecation of the otherwise redundant API. Curious readers can **learn more** about the motivation and the design of this move [in the original proposal](https://github.com/pzuraq/emberjs-rfcs/blob/deprecate-computed-property-modifier/text/0000-deprecate-computed-property-modifier.md).

## [Published sparkles-component 1.1.0 ✨](https://twitter.com/rwjblue/status/1042162296854925314)

[@rwjblue](https://github.com/rwjblue) released version 1.1.0 of the [sparkles-component](https://github.com/rwjblue/sparkles-component) which includes [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) conversion of the library.

<!--alex ignore hooks destroy-->
The sparkles-component is an addon used to experiment with [glimmer component](https://github.com/glimmerjs/glimmer.js/tree/master/packages/%40glimmer/component) style APIs in Ember apps via existing public APIs. It supports most of the `@glimmer/component` API including lifecycle hooks (constructor, didInsertElement, didUpdate, destroy), @tracked properties, ES base class, and decorator support (with the release of 1.1.0, this supports consuming via TypeScript).

To learn more, [@rwjblue](https://github.com/rwjblue) together with [@mike-north](https://github.com/mike-north) live streamed converting the library from JavaScript to TypeScript. You can watch the [live replay on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/311556611).

## [Ember Is a Modern Framework, Tell Your Friends 😄](https://dev.to/nullvoxpopuli/the-emberjs-of-the-future-today-12c)

<!--alex ignore hooks destroy-->
Community member [@NullVoxPopuli](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli) has written a summary of a set of his favorite features that showcase how Ember is a modern framework, and can be attractive to people looking for all the shiny things. Check out [The EmberJS of the future... today!](https://dev.to/nullvoxpopuli/the-emberjs-of-the-future-today-12c) where he discusses async lifecycle hooks, syntax for components, testing, dependency injection, keyboard accessibility and more.

## [Boston-Built ember-css-modules 1.0 AKA "The Big Dig" Is Here 🏗](https://twitter.com/__dfreeman/status/1042837440417988610)

[salsify/ember-css-modules](https://github.com/salsify/ember-css-modules) has launched a 1.0 thanks to bug reports, feature ideas and pull requests from the community over the past couple years! ember-css-modules provides Ember-flavored support for [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). With the addon, styling is a first-class citizen alongside templates and JavaScript, with one CSS file per component.

## [Issue Triage 🕵️](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Ember.js-Issue-Triage--ANXsBgi3NQNstI7fSMQIONfOAg-Bh6AEHTj1Bt4rXq0Awg4R)

<p>
  This week we had 5 volunteers helping 🚑 &nbsp;triage old issues that were inactive,
  we closed 9 and labelled 31 of 50 from last week that need a submitter response 🙀.
  Those 31 may be closed in the next week or two. Together, we addressed 17 issues
  that were inactive (and are still open 📂). We are beginning to establish a cadence
  again of a team addressing issue triage 🛠️ on Friday mornings.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks for your

  The `@emberjs/issues-team` objective is to increase signal-to-noise ratio of issues
  and 🐛 &nbsp;bugs so that the core team (and contributors) can take action to resolve bugs,
  and spend less effort sorting the issues queue. Currently there are about 67 open bugs, of
  those 25 had a reproduction (e.g. using <a href="https://ember-twiddle.com">ember-twiddle.com</a>)
  , and 1 with a pull request - total count about 270. Our aim is to get down to 150 in the next
  couple months. If you'd like to help see the
