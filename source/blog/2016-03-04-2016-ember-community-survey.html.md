2015 was an incredible year to be a web developer, and great year to be
building an Ember app.

Ember 2.0 landed in August, and with it came the first major shift in
application architecture since Ember left its SproutCore roots. The Ember-CLI
team made massive improvements to the speed and quality of our build tooling
several times over, all while continuing to be the foundation for a growing
addon community now topping 2000 projects. Ember-Data stabilized its public
API for the first time in the project's history, and continues to contend
for the title of most complete client-side JavaScript data layer.

Other projects, under the official umbrella and outside it, continue to
innovate and mature.

With 2015 in the rear-view mirror, we should take a moment to check our assumptions
about who is in the Ember community and how they work with the framework.
To that end, we're pleased to announce
the official 2016 Ember Community Survey!

Completing the survey should take about fifteen minutes. We will be accepting
submissions until March 21st.

Please help us spread the word by sharing the above link on your social
network feeds, at meetups and around your office and other communities.

With your answers (all anonymous), we will create some visuals and write up our
insights to share at [EmberConf 2016](http://emberconf.com/) (March 29th-30th).
If you have any immediate questions, feel free to email
