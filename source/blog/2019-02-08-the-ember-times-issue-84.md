## [🆕 EmberWeekly.com](https://www.emberweekly.com/) 💥

Our friends at Ember Weekly launched a new [EmberWeekly.com](https://www.emberweekly.com/). [@ebryn](https://github.com/ebryn) [tweets](https://twitter.com/ebryn/status/1093040993488855040) that the site includes six years of their newsletter's content, fully exposed to the web and now indexable. The site is powered by Ember and Fastboot and will help surface the wondering things happening in the Ember ecosystem! 💛

Looking for Ember resources on the web? A great link to share? Browse the [Reading](https://www.emberweekly.com/?section=Reading) or [Watch & Listen](https://www.emberweekly.com/?section=Watch%2FListen) sections. We think that the site looks pretty slick too.

## [✨ New and Shiny Mirage Docs](http://www.ember-cli-mirage.com/)

As [samselikoff](https://github.com/samselikoff) posted on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/samselikoff/status/1088440182054051840) ember-cli-mirage v0.4.13 is now out and it contains a very cool feature. The old documentation site has been retired and replaced with a [new and shiny site](http://www.ember-cli-mirage.com/) build with [ember-cli-addon-docs](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-cli-addon-docs).

As if that wasn't enough, ember-cli-mirage currently has *0 reproducible bugs*. Help out by trying the latest release and see if you can catch any bugs.
