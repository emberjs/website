## [A framework for ambitious Chrome Extensions ‚öô](https://envoy.engineering/a-framework-for-ambitious-chrome-extensions-b08d1f4b944d)

[Esteban](https://github.com/esbanarango) wrote an article on how he used Ember to create Chrome Extensions by combining multiple addons from around the community. He found a ton of of great _starter_ and _boilerplate_ projects on [GitHub](www.github.com) and identified some key [ember-cli](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli) projects that make working with [Chrome‚Äôs Extension API](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/api_index) much easier.

Specifically, Esteban mentions 3 ember-cli addons: [ember-cli-deploy-chrome-app](https://github.com/rmachielse/ember-cli-deploy-chrome-app), [ember-cli-post-build-copy](https://github.com/tgsoverly/ember-cli-post-build-copy), and [ember-cli-concat](https://github.com/sir-dunxalot/ember-cli-concat) that was instrumental in creating ambitious Chrome Extensions using Ember. He leveraged [ember-concurrency](https://github.com/machty/ember-concurrency) ([or you can use ember-lifeline](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/readers-questions-whats-the-difference-between-ember-lifeline-and-ember-concurrency-and-which-one-should-be-used/15197)) to deal with the callback design structure API that Chrome provides (which was promisified using [chrome-promise](https://github.com/tfoxy/chrome-promise)).

## [One Port to Rule Them All](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/releases/tag/v3.4.0-beta.2)
With `ember-cli@3.4.0-beta.2` you now have the ability to enable the live reloading server and the normal development app server to share a **single port**. With the current state of Ember CLI it opens two HTTP servers - one for the assets and one to support live reloading on file changes.

You can already test this by [getting the beta](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/releases/tag/v3.4.0-beta.2) and see if it works for you. Remember to also check the rest of the changelog for the beta. And if you're interested in the actual work for making the single port work the check out [the PR](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/7940).
