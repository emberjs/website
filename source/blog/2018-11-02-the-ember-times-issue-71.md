## [Make Tree-Shaking 🌲 Ready for Landing ✈️ - Your Help is Wanted!](https://twitter.com/kellyselden/status/1050717338595745792)

A promising approach to reduce the size of Ember apps dramatically is known as **tree-shaking**. This describes a way to **exclude any code** from your **bundle** which is ultimately not needed for your application to work as expected.

The [Packager RFC (Request for Comments) for bringing tree-shaking](https://github.com/ember-cli/rfcs/blob/master/active/0051-packaging.md#tree-shaking)  to Ember apps [had been accepted in April this year](https://github.com/ember-cli/rfcs/commit/567201627bcc6baa2d70103bd5b6f9e23e8ea0d9). Since then, lots of progress has already been made on the Ember & Ember CLI side of things and even [the experimental addon ember-cli-tree-shaker](https://github.com/kellyselden/ember-cli-tree-shaker) has been a tangible product of recent efforts to allow you to try out tree shaking today. But there's still a lot more to do. And **your help is needed**!

If you're feeling up to the task to help tree-shaking land in Ember and you're curious to learn more about Ember CLI internals, be sure to **reach out** to [**@kellyselden** on either Twitter](https://twitter.com/kellyselden/status/1050717338595745792) or the [#topic-tree-shaking Discord channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/480462759797063690/502098552751915008) to get started!

## [The #30DaysOfEmber Series 📚](https://twitter.com/PoslinskiNet/status/1054446639719608320)

[@PoslinskiNet](https://github.com/PoslinskiNet) published a great learning series for those starting out with Ember. The #30DaysOfEmber series goes through **30 topics** ranging from [Computed Properties](https://slides.com/poslinski_net/30-days-of-ember#/6) to [Internationalization](https://slides.com/poslinski_net/30-days-of-ember#/36) with the aim of becoming familiar with Ember at the end of it.

If you haven’t yet, check out the [slides for #30DaysOfEmber](https://slides.com/poslinski_net/30-days-of-ember#/) or on [Twitter Moments](https://twitter.com/i/moments/1054409226968281089) today!
