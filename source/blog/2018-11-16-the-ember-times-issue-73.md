## [Videos From EmberFest Are Out!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN4SpDLOSVkSB9034lDNdP1JoNBGssax9)
The videos from EmberFest are **now available** on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN4SpDLOSVkSB9034lDNdP1JoNBGssax9). This means that you can experience all of the great talks even though you weren’t there! (And you know, if you were there you can now re-live it all).

If you don’t know where to start then we highly recommend the [opening keynote by Tom Dale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRzmDobMZ_Q&t=0s&list=PLN4SpDLOSVkSB9034lDNdP1JoNBGssax9&index=2) and the [closing keynote by Melanie Sumner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP-kog04lng&list=PLN4SpDLOSVkSB9034lDNdP1JoNBGssax9&index=21).

Tom Dale spoke about what will happen next year when you generate a new Ember app. This involves super exciting things like the **module unification app structure**,  **angle bracket invocation**, **JavaScript classes**, **tracked properties** and much more. All of this is of course delivered with the usual Tom Dale dapperness and humor. Definitely worth a watch.

<!-- Waiting for Niels' section about Mel's talk here -->
