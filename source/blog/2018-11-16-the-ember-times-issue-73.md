## [eslint-plugin-ember v6.0.0 is out! 🚓](https://twitter.com/TobiasBieniek/status/1062700572757946368)

[@Turbo87](https://github.com/Turbo87) announced the release of [v6.0.0](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/releases/tag/v6.0.0) of [eslint-plugin-ember] which is an [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) plugin that provides set of rules for Ember Applications based on commonly known good practices.

This new release includes several **breaking changes** to the `ember/recommended` configuration such as [no-restricted-resolver-tests](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/blob/master/docs/rules/no-restricted-resolver-tests.md) and [no-ember-testing-in-module](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/blob/master/docs/rules/no-ember-testing-in-module-scope.md). Check the [release notes](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/releases/tag/v6.0.0) for the full list of breaking changes and enhancements.

Note: If you still use [ESLint 3](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/pull/267) or [Node.js 4](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/pull/255) **this release will not work** for you as this major version change drops support for both of them.
