## [Help Yourselves to Default Template Helpers üçΩÔ∏è](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/388)
If you find yourself often reaching for the addon [ember-truth-helpers](https://github.com/jmurphyau/ember-truth-helpers) in your templates then this [new RFC by @cibernox](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/388) is for you. This **Request for Comments (RFC)** proposes bringing in some of the **template helpers** in `ember-truth-helpers` into **Ember Core**. 

The reasoning behind this is that a few helpers from this addon are so common in Ember apps that it makes sense to add them into Ember Core itself to **reduce the friction** of needing to install an addon to get them.

Another reason that might even be more important is that this could open up **Glimmer VM low level optimizations** as the Glimmer VM itself would know about these helpers.

The proposed helpers to add to core are: `eq`, `not`, `and`, `or`, `gt` and `gte`, `lt` and `lte`.

## [A New Way to Error Handling üö©](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/384)

[A recent **Request for Comments (RFC)**](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/384) from the magical **Ember Data** Land takes us on a journey through **error handling** in Ember: It proposes the addition of new error handling methods which do not affect the state of your data records to the [`DS.Errors`](https://www.emberjs.com/api/ember-data/release/classes/DS.Errors) class.

Read more about the new, proposed API and the motivation behind it [in the original proposal and feel free to discuss](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/384)!

## [üç¨ Sugar-, üçû Gluten- & jQuery-Free Ember Apps üêπ by Default](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/386)

Previous RFC-driven efforts already provided an **option** for you to **exclude jQuery** from your Ember app builds easily ([1](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0294-optional-jquery.html), [2](https://www.emberjs.com/blog/2018/07/16/ember-3-3-released.html#toc_new-features-1), [3](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/64)). Now [a **follow-up RFC**](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/386) takes the idea of **reducing the initial bundle size** of apps even further.

The new proposal envisions apps to provide an **easy opt-in** for the UI library, but to **exclude jQuery by default**. The RFC suggests that this will make it easier for developers and addon authors to provide smaller apps from the start and only include the dependency back in if it is _really_ needed.

Curious to know more? Here's the [full proposal](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/386).

## [We've Got You Covered ‚õë](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/16910)
You might have noticed that sometimes when a new release of Ember is out some API documentation can disappear. This happens when code gets moved around in Ember, such as putting functions in their own modules, which makes it easy to make mistakes that impact the documentation parser. [@ef4](https://github.com/ef4) added [test coverage](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/16910) for exactly these cases.

This means that when a new release is prepared these tests will most likely catch any unintentional documentation changes.

## [Using Relationships Links or Not? Your Call! üîó](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/387)

Fetching your data from a [JSON:API compliant](https://jsonapi.org/) backend? Not sure how to tell Ember Data **explicitly** to look up an included **relationship** in the payload itself vs. via an additional request using the response's `link` attribute?

Possibly, this will be much easier very soon! [Another new, Ember Data related RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/387) proposed the addition of a `shouldFindViaLink` method to the public API of REST **adapters**. According to the proposal, users may overwrite this method - which should return a _Boolean_ to indicate if Ember Data should look up relationship data via links or not - themselves for custom behavior and gain full control of their relational data loading.

You can **read more** about the design of this proposed API [**in the RFC itself**](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/387)!

## [New Addon Release: ember-self-focused üëÅÔ∏è](https://github.com/linkedin/self-focused/tree/master/packages/ember-self-focused)

<!--alex ignore spa-->
User interface transitions that happen in a single-page application (SPA) are problematic for **screen reading software** since traditionally they are reliant on reading out the text on page load. Since there are some visual changes on the screen but the page does not reload in an SPA, it makes it difficult for screen reading software users to be aware of UI changes.

To solve this issue, [@sarbbottam](https://github.com/sarbbottam) released a brand new addon to enable screen reading software to speak the content of the new node by **focusing on the HTML node of the dynamic content**. The new addon [ember-self-focused](https://github.com/linkedin/self-focused/tree/master/packages/ember-self-focused) provides a **component** and a **service** to keep track of the HTML nodes to be focused.

Check out more in [@sarbbottam](https://github.com/sarbbottam)'s [blog post](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2018/10/making-ember-applications--ui-transitions-screen-reader-friendly) or at the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/linkedin/self-focused/tree/master/packages/ember-self-focused)!
