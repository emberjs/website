## [A New Way to Error Handling 🚩](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/384)

[A recent **Request for Comments (RFC)**](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/384) from the magical **Ember Data** Land takes us on a journey through **error handling** in Ember: It proposes the addition of new error handling methods which do not affect the state of your data records to the [`DS.Errors`](https://www.emberjs.com/api/ember-data/release/classes/DS.Errors) class.

Read more about the new, proposed API and the motivation behind it [in the original proposal and feel free to discuss](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/384)!

## [🍬 Sugar-, 🍞 Gluten- & jQuery-Free Ember Apps 🐹 by Default](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/386)

Previous RFC-driven efforts already provided an **option** for you to **exclude jQuery** from your Ember app builds easily ([1](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0294-optional-jquery.html), [2](https://www.emberjs.com/blog/2018/07/16/ember-3-3-released.html#toc_new-features-1), [3](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/64)). Now [a **follow-up RFC**](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/386) takes the idea of **reducing the initial bundle size** of apps even further.

The new proposal envisions apps to provide an **easy opt-in** for the UI library, but to **exclude jQuery by default**. The RFC suggests that this will make it easier for developers and addon authors to provide smaller apps from the start and only include the dependency back in if it is _really_ needed.

Curious to know more? Here's the [full proposal](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/386).
