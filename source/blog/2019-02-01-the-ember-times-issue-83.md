<!--alex ignore period-->
2019 is coming in strong with a staggering amount of RFCs in Final Comment Period (FCP). So come and check out these awesome work!

[Tracked Properties RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/410) by [@pzuraq](https://github.com/pzuraq) which introduces a simpler and more ergonomic system for tracking state change in Ember applications.

[Contextual Helpers & Modifiers RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/432) by [@chancancode](https://github.com/chancancode) or supporting first-class helpers/modifiers in our templates.

Two deprecation RFCs by [@chadhietala](https://github.com/chadhietala) are now in FCP - [Deprecate Application Controller Router Properties RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/421) and [Deprecate Route Render APIs RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/418).

Finally the [Restructuring the Guides Table of Contents RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/431) by [@jenweber](https://github.com/jenweber) where the [Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/) will be rearranged to provide a natural learning flow for today’s Ember.js developers is also in FCP.

## [Native Class Update - 2019 Edition 📝](https://emberjs.com/blog/2019/01/26/emberjs-native-class-update-2019-edition.html)

[@pzuraq](https://github.com/pzuraq) wrote a blog post on native classes in Ember, which officially landed in v3.6. The article focuses on current best practices and changes since the original [how-to article](https://medium.com/build-addepar/es-classes-in-ember-js-63e948e9d78e) was posted. If you're curious about native classes in Ember, be sure to read Chris' [detailed and informative writeup](https://emberjs.com/blog/2019/01/26/emberjs-native-class-update-2019-edition.html)!

## [Ember.js Core Team Face-to-Face 🐹](https://emberjs.com/blog/2019/01/25/framework-f2f.html)
In December the **Ember.js Core Team met in-person** and remotely to review the direction that the framework API is headed, work through some architectural design questions, and figure out next steps. This resulted in [a blog post](https://emberjs.com/blog/2019/01/25/framework-f2f.html) summarizing all the cool things that were discussed. This means that you can have a look on the **Octane discussion** as well as a review of **website improvement progress**. If that sounds interesting to you, then you should check out [the blog post](https://emberjs.com/blog/2019/01/25/framework-f2f.html).

In the 4th edition of the contributor interview series, we'd like to highlight the work of community member **Jen Weber**, also known as [@jenweber](https://github.com/jenweber). In this exclusive interview with the Ember Times she talks about her work on the [Ember Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com/), what the next edition of Ember means for the framework’s learning story and which of her learnings from working on open-source have turned out to become powerful assets for her own career.
