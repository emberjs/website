<SAYING-HELLO-IN-YOUR-FAVORITE-LANGUAGE> Emberistas! 🐹

<SOME-INTRO-HERE-TO-KEEP-THEM-SUBSCRIBERS-READING>,

This week **boolean component arguments** 0️⃣1️⃣ are in for an **RFC**, want to learn more about component patterns 📚🧐?

---

## [Boolean Dreams Come True 0️⃣💭⃣1️⃣](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/407)

Ever wanted to pass **boolean arguments** to your **components** _just_ like you would pass boolean attributes - like checked or readonly - to an HTML element?

This fresh [RFC (Request for Comments) discusses how this could become reality](https://github.com/hakubo/rfcs/blob/component-boolean-arguments/text/0000-component-boolean-arguments.md)!

Leave your thoughts on how boolean arguments could be implemented for Ember components in the comments [below the original proposal](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/407).

## [Components patterns in Ember Blog 📚🧐](https://twitter.com/TheMacsour/status/1072088269742112768)

[@Exelord](https://github.com/Exelord) published a blog post on [component patterns in Ember](https://medium.com/macsour/components-patterns-in-ember-js-5e6fc6eea28f). The article presents a collection of **component patterns** used in the Ember community for readers to better understand what kind of component pattern would best match their particular use case.

[@Exelord](https://github.com/Exelord) particularly outlines 4 types of components: **presentational, contextual, container, and composable (or higher-order component)** with code samples including references!

Read more about it the [blog post](https://medium.com/macsour/components-patterns-in-ember-js-5e6fc6eea28f)!
