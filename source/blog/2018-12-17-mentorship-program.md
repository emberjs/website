We are pleased to announce the creation of the [Ember Mentorship Program](https://emberconf.com/mentorship-program.html)!

Mentorship has been a strong theme throughout Ember’s existence. We started with our first core team members pairing together at the creation of Ember, and today it’s one of the foundational parts of our DNA. Now we’re formalizing many of the things we already do, into a more structured community-wide initiative, so we can do an even better job. 

Mentorship is a responsibility shared by our entire community, and we’re excited to help it grow. It’s a celebration and elevation of the work that many, many people have contributed to, and a public statement that this is something we care about, prioritize, and intend to keep on doing.

## Established Initiatives

In addition to some fun new plans, the Ember Mentorship Program umbrella captures a bunch of existing efforts. Some are face-to-face events at conferences, and others are remote. They include:

- The Mentorship Workshop and mixer, an annual event at [EmberConf](https://emberconf.com) that matches about 20 mentors with about 20 mentees

- The Women Helping Women program, which helps support women who want to speak, lead, and contribute within and outside of the Ember community. Participation is open to women and nonbinary people. To join, just ask in [Ember Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/zT3asNS)'s `#discord-server-admin` channel.
- New Contributor Mentorship, the (currently informal) process where experienced contributors in the Ember ecosystem pair up with those who are learning and exploring. Join `#discord-server-admin` of Ember Discord to get started.
- Meetup Support, where organizers of groups around the world support each other and share ideas about the things that are and aren’t working for their groups. 

## What’s New?

EmberConf 2019 will be an annual opportunity for us to explore new areas for the program to grow into. For example, at EmberConf 2019 there will be the first gathering for POC, led by Elrick Ryan and Ashlen Price!
More details are coming soon.

The Mentorship Program also embraces the idea that mentorship opportunities should be available to anyone in the community — not just those who can make it to EmberConf.
Here are some of the forms that takes:

1. An [event kit](https://github.com/ember-learn/mentorship-workshop) that anyone can use to run mentorship workshops in their local meetups or conferences, with guidance and support from past leaders.
2. Online events open to all participants around the world, at varying times to accommodate many time zones.
3. Adding content to the awesome [Help Wanted](https://help-wanted.emberjs.com/) app to give new contributors more specific directions on how to get involved and who to ask for help.
4. Raising awareness of efforts like the Women Helping Women initiative, so new members can join and benefit from it.
5. The Speaker Support Program, which previously existed under the Women Helping Women program, and is now growing to be a general purpose effort open to all.
It will help match speakers who want to improve their skills or practice, with others who can give guidance and feedback.


## Why this focus? When will these things happen?

The reality of open source communities is that we have to choose where to spend energy carefully (though in the best case scenarios, we don’t have to choose because the goals align!).
Focusing on organizing and improving work that’s already being done means there’s minimal overhead to the improvements around the edges.

If you don’t see your own ideas on these lists, get in touch!
Everything we’ve done so far were grew from community volunteers and interest, and our we hope that more of you will come forward to help us build this up even more. 
Mentorship-type efforts are really about the one-on-one connections we’re able to help foster along the way, which means every single participant makes a difference.


## How to get involved
