Blein Vie Noa, Emberistas! üêπüéÜüéá

The new year starts off with loads of **new RFCs**! Read more about **extending** the **Ember Inspector** üëìüêπ, and suggested **deprecations** of **Route render** methods and selected **ApplicationController properties** ÔøΩ! We also have a new RFC for a brand new look of emberjs.com...

## [Website Redesign üé®](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/425)
The official Ember website is due for a new look and feel. That is why a [new RFC](https://github.com/wifelette/rfcs/blob/master/text/0425-website-redesign.md) proposes a **completely new look** üíÖ for emberjs.com. A side effect of not having updated the look and feel of the website for some years is that for people who aren‚Äôt involved in the day-to-day of Ember development, it‚Äôs **easy to miss just how well the framework has kept up over the years**. 

 The redesign aims to **modernize, update and improve all the things on the website** so that the impression given to the general public matches reality.

There‚Äôs already a good discussion going on in the [RFC comment section](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/425), and we would love to hear your thoughts as well.

## [Ember Inspector (Extended)](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/417)

The [**Ember Inspector**](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/ember-inspector/) is _the_ dev tool for Ember developers debugging their apps. But how much cooler would it be, if Ember addons would have a way to extend the Inspector's feature set with their own tooling?
A new [RFC (Request for Comments) suggests to make the Ember Inspector extensible](https://github.com/thorsteinsson/rfcs/blob/extensible-inspector/text/0000-extensible-inspector.md) in such a way and could use community feedback!

Leave your thoughts and suggestions about an extensible Ember Inspector [below the original proposal](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/417)!

## [Deprecating Route Induced Rendering üé®](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/418)

Do you remember `Route.render()` and `Route.renderTemplate()`? You might not. In fact, these route methods have been less and less emphasised in the Ember learning story and are not even mentioned in the [Ember Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/) anymore. Although these APIs were useful in the past, nowadays a component-focussed approach allows Ember developers to omit them entirely.

Therefore, a **new RFC** suggests the **deprecation** of `Route#render` and `Route#renderTemplate`. You can read more about the motivation behind it and how to replace these methods in your application in [the original proposal](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/ddbf21eaefae946a7e97573fec10334fb104e259/text/0418-deprecate-route-render-methods.md).

Questions? Suggestions? Leave them right in the [comments section of the RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/418)!

## [Deprecating Router Props on Application Controllers üéõ](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/421)

With the introduction of [the Router Service](https://www.emberjs.com/api/ember/release/classes/RouterService) it's been easier than ever to check on current app state, e.g. the name of the active route, anywhere in your application. This also means that the current `ApplicationController#currentPath` and `ApplicationController#currentRouteName` API has become obsolete.

A **new RFC** proposes the [deprecation of these abundant properties](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/a7ea6898280cd065cb5183d3245cceba3fd2e91b/text/0421-deprecate-application-controller-props.md) in the future. Be sure to [let your thoughts known in the proposal's comments section](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/421)!

## [API Search Performance](https://twitter.com/mschinis/status/1080923571109724162)

<img class="float-left small transparent padded" alt="Algolia search improvements" src="/images/blog/emberjstimes/algolia-search-performance-improvements.png" />

The integration with our search provider, [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) that powers both [Ember Guides](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-app) and [Ember API Docs](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-api-docs) has now become even more performant!

Our friends are Algolia have enabled us to improve API docs search performance by as high as 285% for some countries in Europe! The map shows data centers where the API docs are currently stored and (on the right) the performance improvement for the top searching countries.
