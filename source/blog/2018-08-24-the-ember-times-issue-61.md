## [Jazz Up Your Tags with Modifiers ‚ú®](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/353)

A new **Request for Comments (RFC)** might bring new life to your HTML tags:
The [proposal for Modifiers](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/new-modifiers/text/0000-modifiers.md) presents a possible future API for components in Ember which allows to
add custom behaviour, like event listeners or styles, to DOM nodes in your components. **Reliable access to DOM nodes** will be guaranteed by the means of these **element modifiers**, alleviating issues with the `outerHTML` semantics [mentioned in the `this.bounds` RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/351#issuecomment-412123046) which proposed a new way of accessing the root element of future Ember components.

This **RFC is a successor** of the previous [RFC#111: Element Modifiers](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/112) and aims to bring many of the previously mentioned ideas back into discussion.

Be sure to [read the original proposal over at Github](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/353) and share your thoughts and questions in [the comments for the RFC's pull request](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/353).

<div class="blog-row">
  <img class="float-right small transparent padded" alt="Office Hours Tomster Mascot" title="Readers' Questions" src="/images/tomsters/officehours.png" />

  <p>The JavaScript ecosystem is full of <strong>bundlers</strong>, like Webpack, Rollup.js, Microbundle among others. But what differentiates one from the other? And what makes Broccoli so special to be part of Ember's build pipeline?</p>

<p>In this week's Readers' Question, Ember Learning Core team member <a href="https://github.com/jessica-jordan" target="jj">@jessica-jordan</a> will highlight the <strong>differences</strong> between some of the most <strong>popular JavaScript bundlers</strong> and explain why Ember CLI embraced <strong>Broccoli</strong> as its tool of choice early on. You can read her <a href="#url-to-be-updated" target="rq">full answer on the official Ember Forum.</a></p>

<p><a class="ember-button" href="#url-to-be-updated" target="rq">Read more</a></p>
<br/>

<p><strong>Submit your own</strong> short and sweet <strong>question</strong> under <a href="https://bit.ly/ask-ember-core" target="rq">bit.ly/ask-ember-core</a>. And don‚Äôt worry, there are no silly questions, we appreciate them all - promise! ü§û</p>
