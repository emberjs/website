## [Don't Worry, Ember CLI Got You Covered](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-update) 🖳
The **number one** tool for updating Ember.js apps or addons just got **even better**. The [newest version](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-update/releases) of `ember-cli-update` now runs `qunit-dom-codemod` for you. This means that you, with close to no effort at all, can utilize this great addon for your tests.

And the cool things is that `ember-cli-update` fetches new codemods **during runtime** - so no need to update to get this nice codemod! To run the codemod just type `ember-cli-update --run-codemods` and magic will take care of the rest for you.

You can visit the addon page for [ember-cli-update](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-update) to read all about it or visit [qunit-dom](https://github.com/simplabs/qunit-dom) to learn about all the nice features it provides.

## [Find Ember on the Interwebs with the Power of SEO 🔎](https://embercommunity.slack.com/archives/CAHEZTMBK)

These past days, weeks and months lots of efforts have been focused on improving the
discoverability of official Ember resources including the website, the Guides or the API docs.
The visibility of these sites to various search engines 🔍 , for example, DuckDuckGo, Baidu, AOL Search, Dogpile or Google
plays a major role in how easy it is for developers to find the information they are looking for.
To improve Ember's visibility on the web, Search-Engine Optimization (SEO) of these pages is one of the most effective measures.

Simple, yet effective improvements for Ember sites included tests of functional redirects ([1](https://github.com/emberjs/website/pull/3394)) and fixes for broken links ([2](https://github.com/emberjs/website/pull/3271), [3](https://github.com/emberjs/website/pull/3183), [4](https://github.com/emberjs/website/pull/3182)).
Other high-impact efforts included a [new meta data structure for the new Guides](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-app/pull/135)
and the continuous evaluation of web crawler data.

If you have previous experience with SEO and you're interested in casting some keyword magic ✨🎩 for Ember sites,
check out the [\#st-website](https://embercommunity.slack.com/archives/CAHEZTMBK) channel on the
[Ember Community Slack Chat](https://ember-community-slackin.herokuapp.com/)
and join other SEO analysts in their quest to make Ember the No. 1 search result on [Ask.com](https://ask.com/web?o=0&l=dir&qo=serpSearchTopBox&q=the+most+ambitious+JS+mvc+framework+must+have+a+cute+mascot).

## [RFC: Goodbye Slack, Hello Discord 💬](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/345)

[@MelSumner](https://github.com/MelSumner) has proposed an [RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/345) recommending that the Ember community chat move from Slack to Discord. Ever had a message on the Ember Slack disappear on you in a channel or DM? Discord stores chat logs forever, so losing history would no longer be an issue. Better communication and transparency FTW!

Our one gripe with the potential move is the confusion between [Discourse](https://discuss.emberjs.com/) and [Discord](https://discordapp.com/)... 😅

Discord is the chat host to [many open source projects](https://discordapp.com/open-source), such as Yarn, Vue.js, and Reactiflux.

Have some thoughts on the proposal? Get involved on the [RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/345)!
