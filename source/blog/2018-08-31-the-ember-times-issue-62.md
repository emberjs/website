## [RFC: Ember 2018 Roadmap 🛣](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/364)

[Tom Dale](https://github.com/tomdale) published an [RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/364) for the Ember 2018 Roadmap based on the feedback collected from the [#EmberJS2018 call for blog posts](https://www.emberjs.com/blog/2018/05/02/ember-2018-roadmap-call-for-posts.html) earlier this year. Tom identified 3 key goals for Ember in 2018 along with 2 real world use cases to focus on.

### Goals:

**1. Improve communication and streamline decision-making, and empower new leaders.**
Make users feel empowered to become contributors and at the same time expanding and refining the core team structure which includes mentoring new leaders and cross-pollinating knowledge between teams.

**2. Finish the major initiatives that we’ve already started.**
Add extension points to allow popular new tools to be quickly adopted in Ember apps and standardize around ES modules and npm packages to better enable the sharing of Ember tools with the wider JavaScript community.

**3. Ship a new edition, Ember Octane, focused on performance and productivity.**
Tell the story of modern Ember by shipping a new edition of Ember that has compatibility with new JavaScript language features like native classes, decorators, and async functions by default.

### Use Cases:

**1. Productivity apps**
Ember’s historical strength: sophisticated, highly interactive apps that users spend a lot of time in, getting things done.

**2. Content apps**
Text-heavy pages where the first load is critical. In performance-constrained environments, Ember’s strong conventions can help developers build faster apps by default.
