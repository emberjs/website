Xin chào Emberistas! 🐹

Read either on the [Ember blog](https://www.emberjs.com/blog/2018/08/03/the-ember-times-issue-58.html) or in our [e-mail newsletter](https://the-emberjs-times.ongoodbits.com) what has been going on in Emberland this week.

This time we have a call-to-action to shape the future of the **new Ember homepage** 🎨👩‍🎨 for you, as well as a brand-new **RFC for the Ember CLI Docs** 📖,
important **accessibility** updates for **ember-toggle** 🔘 and a special **thank you note** for some of our dedicated contributors ✨

## [The Quest for Better Documentation](https://github.com/ember-cli/rfcs/pull/120)

There’s a [brand new RFC (Request for Comments)](https://github.com/jenweber/rfcs-1/blob/cli-guides/active/0000-cli-guides.md) for restructuring and refreshing the Ember CLI docs. [Jen Weber](https://twitter.com/jwwweber) prepared a great overview of what needs to change to make **Ember CLI documentation great again**. This is especially important since these changes could empower new contributors, correct outdated information and make the learning process way easier.

Besides a restructure of the information architecture, Jen proposes to use personas as a way of understanding what changes are needed, as well as transforming the site into an Ember app.

Community feedback is as always appreciated. Head over to the [proposal](https://github.com/ember-cli/rfcs/pull/120) and **leave your comments** below.

## [Ember Homepage Survey](https://www.emberjs.com/blog/2018/07/30/ember-homepage-survey.html)

We're **redesigning** [emberjs.com](https://emberjs.com/) and we need your help.

We want to find out what makes you continue to use Ember in a world full of alternatives, so we can better communicate Ember's value proposition to others who might find similar success.

By taking a **few minutes** to [answer these questions](https://www.emberjs.com/homepage-survey), you can **help influence** the messaging behind Ember's future homepage and any other marketing materials we create.

## [Ember-Toggle Updated 🛠](https://github.com/knownasilya/ember-toggle/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#530-2018-07-31)

The **accessibilty** on [ember-toggle](https://github.com/knownasilya/ember-toggle) has stepped up.

According to its changelog, the new version [5.3.0](https://github.com/knownasilya/ember-toggle/compare/v5.2.4...v5.3.0) was released last Tuesday, making it possible to use the spacebar to change the state of the toggle once highlighted.

Awesome news! We love Ember addons. 🐹 ❤️ 📦

Even though we're already trying to highlight the amazing and consistent efforts of community contributors in our weekly **Contributors' Corner**, we'd like to take the time to say a special thank you to a couple of ambitious contributors to learning resources specifically:

We're grateful for all the outstanding contributions [@hakilebara](https://github.com/hakilebara) made to learning resources recently. This included a [from-the-scratch setup](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-styleguide/pull/76) of the [ember-styleguide docs](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-styleguide) and [improvements to the offical Guides](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/112).

We also appreciate all the efforts by [@sivakumar-kailasam](https://github.com/sivakumar-kailasam) and [@toddjordan](https://github.com/toddjordan)
to fix missing modules, upgrade and improve the Ember API Docs these days ([1](https://github.com/ember-learn/algolia-index-update-scripts/pull/4), [2](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/16836), [3](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-jsonapi-docs/commits?author=sivakumar-kailasam&since=2018-06-30T22:00:00Z&until=2018-07-31T22:00:00Z)).

Thank you for all your work! ❤️
