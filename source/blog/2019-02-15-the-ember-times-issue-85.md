## [Ember.js: The Documentary is Now Released! üçø](https://twitter.com/honeypotio/status/1094974913725849606)

<!--alex ignore spa-->
JavaScript was not always the dominant force in the web. Today a lot of SPA features we see around the web were pioneered by Ember. Explore the story of why and how Ember.js came to be in [Ember.js: The Documentary](http://videos.honeypot.io/emberjs-documentary-2019/)!

Here are some quick snippets from the film:

> ‚ÄúJavaScript frameworks don‚Äôt have to be disposable software. Web applications don‚Äôt have to be disposable software. You don‚Äôt need to tell your manager we need to stop writing any new features for the next 6 months because it‚Äôs been 2 years and we need to rewrite ‚Äì Ember is a symbol of the fact that that is a false dichotomy.‚Äù - Tom Dale

> ‚ÄúI really hope the best of Ember is ahead because I think front end engineering needs it ‚Ä¶ needs an example of something that is not trying to tell people that when something goes wrong it‚Äôs their own fault. So like something that tells you if you‚Äôre a beginner like this is for you.‚Äù - Yehuda Katz
