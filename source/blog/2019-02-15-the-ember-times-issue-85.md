<SAYING-HELLO-IN-YOUR-FAVORITE-LANGUAGE> Emberistas! 🐹

Watch the Ember.js Documentary 🍿, an exclusive interview with Ember contributor @eshtadc,

## [Ember.js: The Documentary is Now Released! 🍿](https://twitter.com/honeypotio/status/1094974913725849606)

<!--alex ignore spa-->
JavaScript was not always the dominant force in the web. Today a lot of SPA features we see around the web were pioneered by Ember. Explore the story of why and how Ember.js came to be in [Ember.js: The Documentary](http://videos.honeypot.io/emberjs-documentary-2019/)!

Here are some quick snippets from the film:

> “JavaScript frameworks don’t have to be disposable software. Web applications don’t have to be disposable software. You don’t need to tell your manager we need to stop writing any new features for the next 6 months because it’s been 2 years and we need to rewrite – Ember is a symbol of the fact that that is a false dichotomy.” - Tom Dale

> “I really hope the best of Ember is ahead because I think front end engineering needs it … needs an example of something that is not trying to tell people that when something goes wrong it’s their own fault. So like something that tells you if you’re a beginner like this is for you.” - Yehuda Katz

At the January [Boston Ember.js Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Boston-Ember-js/) members of the Ember.js core team got together for a panel on the future of JavaScript.

Team members Tom Dale, Robert Jackson, Edward Faulkner, Dan Gebhardt and Jen Weber discussed their picks for the most exciting future developments in JavaScript and their impact on the web and the Ember.js ecosystem, followed by a super interesting Q&A. Topics included web assembly and it's effect on mobile web application performance, web workers, decorators, learning stories and more! ✨

## [Farewell, computed().meta()](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/441)

Following the **deprecation** of other **modifier functions** of **computed properties** in the past ([1](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0375-deprecate-computed-property-modifier.html), [2](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0370-deprecate-computed-volatile.html)),
a new Request for Comments (RFC) proposes the [deprecation of the `meta()` modifier](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/441).

The once useful function for sharing and looking up meta information through a cp, can now be easily substituted by using `WeakMap`s - making the deprecation of `computed().meta()` possible as proposed in the RFC.

You can read more about the suggested transition path in the [full proposal](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/51b57a865a3c58393c44d73f1c4931878c994eef/text/0000-deprecate-computed-meta.md). And as always, don't forget to [comment, too](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/441)!
