à²¹à²²à³‹ Emberistas!

This week you may again enjoy the newsletter in both [the e-mail](https://the-emberjs-times.ongoodbits.com/)
and the [blog format](#) and share it even better with all your Ember friends.

In this edition we will tell you more about....

Here's a recap of what happened in Emberland these days âœ¨

## [All good from 10 to 4 in Ember CLI](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/7791)

This week contributors to Ember CLI worked on improving the test suite by
[extending the list of Node versions](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/7791) tested against.
This means that you will be able to user your favorite command line tool even
on the latest version of NodeJS smoothly and without any worries.

Also lots of efforts are underway to bring Treeshaking capabilities to your
Ember app very soon. Several contributions this week ([1](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/7788),
[2](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/7786),
[3](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/7784)) aimed at improving the internal
packaging manager of Ember CLI. Wanna know more about the new exciting things
that are on the horizon for Ember CLI in 2018? Do not miss the annual [roadmap for 2018](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/ember-cli-2018-edition/14543) - it's worth the read!

Finally, `ember-cli-update`, _the way_ to update your Ember apps still needs
an update from you to make its adoption in the Ember community as smooth as possible.

You can help out by [updating](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-update/issues/288) any of the several official documentation resources to both
mention the command line tool and to show how to use it.
Also more help is wanted in reminding `ember-cli-update` users if [a new version is out](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-update/issues/326).
We're looking forward to your upgrades! âœ¨

## [EMBER - Ember 3.1.1 Released](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/releases/tag/v3.1.1)
This week a patch for Ember was released. It includes several bug fixes but here are a few selected ones:

[A bug](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16379) was introduced in Ember 3.1 that caused `ariaRole` to not be appended if this was initially set as being `false`. The expected behaviour here is that if I initially set the `ariaRole` to false it should not be appended, but I might want to dynamically change this later on. This is now fixed with Ember 3.1.1.

After upgrading to 3.1 [some people](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16503) started seeing errors like `Cannot read property 'syscall' of null`. This was caused by `ComponentDefinitions` leaking heap space. This has as well been fixed in Ember 3.1.1.

Ember 3.1.1 contains several more fixes. You can go though them all in [the release change log.](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/releases/tag/v3.1.1)

## [Learning Team corner](https://emberjs.com/blog/2018/04/22/ember-learning-update.html)

The Learning Team met IRL at EmberConf and shared the results of that meeting on [the Ember blog](https://emberjs.com/blog/2018/04/22/ember-learning-update.html). Initiatives for the new year were grouped into two directions - User Support and Marketing.

The new guides app will be launching soon! The main difference is that is in an Ember app, making it easier for Ember folks to contribute. And because of [prember](https://github.com/ef4/prember), it's fully SEO-friendly! Deprecation for the old guides is happening [here](https://github.com/emberjs/guides#notice-this-repository-is-deprecated).
