Although most of our collaboration takes place on Github, IRC 
(`#emberjs` on freenode.net), and our [Discourse site](http://discuss.emberjs.com/)
the [Ember.js Core Team](/team) meets privately every 
Friday at 2pm EST/11am PST through Google Hangout for a weekly 
discussion of all things Ember.

We want to ensure that our process and thinking is totally transparent
to the Ember.js community so we're going to start publishing meeting
notes here.

If you have a topic you'd like to see covered, contact your favorite
core team member and let them know!

#### Attendees
@ebryn, @krisselden, @machty, @stefanpenner, @tomdale, @trek, @wagenet, @wycats

### Topics

#### Transparency
We've heard a few comments that people would like greater Core Team transparency.
Since the weekly meetings are the only significant group communication that isn't
public, we'll be posting notes from these meetings.

Resolutions:

  * @trek publish core team meeting notes
  * @trek post weekly reminders that the core team meeting occurs and invite people
    to contact individual core team members if they have issued they’d like raised.

#### HTMLBars
@wycats says it’s ready to hand off to someone else. 

Resolutions:
  
  * @krisselden will come a bit early to the face to face to get mind-dumped. @machty
    is already familiar with writing Handlebars runtime compatible template languages
    from his work on [Emblem.js](http://emblemjs.com/) so can also help get this
    over the last few hurdles.
