## [Hacktoberfest üéÉüçªüë®‚Äçüíª](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

Trick or treat! The fifth annual Hacktoberfest is here! Support open source and earn a limited edition T-shirt by making **five** pull requests this month to any public repos...why not all Ember ones?!

Looking for something to work on? Pop into the [#hacktoberfest](https://discordapp.com/channels/480462759797063690/496453502298750988) channel on the [Ember Community Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/zT3asNS) and ask away with questions! Here are some issues to get you started:

* [ember-learn/cli-guides-source](https://github.com/ember-learn/cli-guides-source/issues)
* [ember-learn/ember-api-docs](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-api-docs/labels/hacktoberfest)

Want to help improve Ember Observer? Have a friend or coworker looking for their first open source pull request? A mere 977 addon repos on [emberobserver.com/lists/invalid-repo-url](https://emberobserver.com/lists/invalid-repo-url) are missing the `repository` key from their `package.json`. For more info, reference the [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#repository), and some sample pull requests [[1](https://github.com/Addepar/addepar-ember-toolbox/pull/29), [2](https://github.com/Duder-onomy/ember-fetch-jsonp/pull/45)]...rinse and repeat for every addon repo. Thanks [@cah-danmonroe](https://github.com/cah-danmonroe) and [@ctpip](https://github.com/ctcpip) for getting this effort started! üíØ

## [Come Play in the Ember CodeSandbox üèñÔ∏èüè∞](https://medium.com/@mikenorth/ember-community-meet-codesandbox-10a43076b3fa)

[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) is an online code editor for **the Web**, and now for **Ember** as well! [@mike-north](https://github.com/mike-north) has done a lot of work to get Ember CLI working inside of CodeSandbox so that we can **develop, showcase, and share** live apps on the web!

What allowed this to happen is that CodeSandbox released server-side evaluated sandboxes, which now allows CLI Node apps to run and be served by the site.

Of course we want to give a shoutout to [@Gaurav0](https://github.com/Gaurav0) and the rest of the [Ember Twiddle](https://ember-twiddle.com/) team for their **amazing** work. The way Ember Twiddle works is by [emulating](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-twiddle/blob/ac116eb20d1e6c2152313f865159c443a9e2bd6f/app/services/ember-cli.js#L261-L295) a node environment. With CodeSandbox, we get **real Ember CLI** out of the box.

There are of course a few issues that Mike is working on fixing, but we believe that this will be stable and usable soon. For example, `ember new app` doesn't work.

To try this out today just use this [starter kit](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/mike-north/ember-new-output/tree/vanilla) or if you are feeling **adventurous** try out this [TypeScript starter kit](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/mike-north/ember-new-output/tree/typescript).

To learn more make sure to check out the [blog post](https://medium.com/@mikenorth/ember-community-meet-codesandbox-10a43076b3fa) and follow [Mike on Twitter](https://twitter.com/michaellnorth/status/1047231228020023296) to stay updated!

## [Introducing: Storybook for Ember! üìñ](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/pull/4237)

With the [v4.0.0 alpha release](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/releases/tag/v4.0.0-alpha.24) of Storybook, [@gabrielcsapo](https://github.com/gabrielcsapo) helped provide an exciting addition to Ember tooling - [adding Storybook support](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/pull/4237)!

[Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) is a separate UI **development environment** for your UI components. It allows you to explore your **component library**, work on a **single component in isolation**, and view the **different states of each component**. This enables developers to see the functioning UI of the component along with expectations on what to pass as arguments to that component to behave in a certain way.

There are plenty of [featured examples](https://storybook.js.org/examples/) that you can reference to see how Storybook works. We are excited to see the productivity and convenience this tool will bring to Ember!
