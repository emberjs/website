Today I'm happy to announce that Igor Terzic is joining the Ember.js
core team.

Igor has been instrumental in the development of Ember Data. He has both
fixed bugs relentlessly and landed major new features, such as the
recent work on modelling relationships as entities with a single source
of truth.

Thanks to his hard work, Ember Data is rapidly approaching a stable
release, and it's no exaggeration to say that we couldn't have done it
without him.

Igor has been maintaining Ember Data diligently for some time now, and
we are overdue in recognizing his efforts via membership to the core
team. As Ember Data is more than ever a core part of the Ember
experience, we're looking forward to even tighter coordination between
the two projects.

You can [follow Igor on Twitter](https://twitter.com/terzicigor) if
you'd like to keep tabs as he travels the world. Thank you, Igor, for
all of your hard work, and welcome to the core team!
