## [Meet Your Ember 🐹 Friends At Discord 🗨](https://discord.gg/zT3asNS)

The time has come: The **Ember Community is starting its big move over to [Discord](https://discord.gg/zT3asNS)**. As proposed in the [original and just recently accepted RFC (Request For Comments) for the migration](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/345) you can now **chat** with your **Ember friends** 🐹👭👬👫 from all around the world on the Ember Discord server. This comes - among other benefits - with the advantage of **unlimited message history**.

[Check out the new community chat today](https://discord.gg/zT3asNS), be sure to **set up your profile** as described in the [#setup-profile channel]() and to join [#discord-server-admin]() to gain access to your favorite discussions 💬.
