Only a few more days left, I hope everyone's had a great 2012,
while you get ready for the New Year, here's what's been happening in Ember.

### New Router API

The new router API is has been [merged into
master!](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/commit/44b23dcf245b0fffdeb29f9f8a5d1bbdc9eb7690)
We've spent a lot of time incorporating feedback about our first
iteration of the router, and we think you're going to really love what
we've come up with. It makes getting started super simple, and
eliminates the old API that forced you to write unwieldy nested objects.

There is a [short walkthrough](https://gist.github.com/3981133) that
describes the thinking behind the new API. Full documentation should be
landing this week.

### Embedded Records

After a massive refactor of the Ember Data library, it now fully
supports embedded records, amongst other goodies.

As always, check out [BREAKING_CHANGES](https://github.com/emberjs/data/blob/master/BREAKING_CHANGES.md)
for information about updating your apps.

### DS.JSONSerializer
In the last post we talked about the changes in the serialization API's renaming methods
to remove the JSON specificity whilst adding hooks to manage relationship dirtiness.

We've now fully extracted all the JSON semantics from `DS.Serializer` into it's own class.
The `DS.JSONSerializer` is a subclass of `DS.Serializer` which implements
the JSON-specific semantics. The `RESTAdapter` now uses the `JSONSerializer` by
default so if you are using that there is no need to change anything in your application.

After some feedback we've also renamed `toData/fromData` to `serialize/deserialize`
for a more friendly API.

As always, check out [BREAKING_CHANGES](https://github.com/emberjs/data/blob/master/BREAKING_CHANGES.md)
for more information.

### Bound handlebars helpers

Ember.Handlebars just got a little bit smarter. `Ember.Handlebars.registerBoundHelper`
provides a way to easily create your own bound custom helpers.

#### Example:
```javascript
  Ember.Handlebars.registerBoundHelper('capitalize', function(value) {
    return value.toUpperCase();
  });
```
which can be used in your templates as follows:

```handlebars
  {{capitalize name}}
```

### Ember.Object.create behavior change

The new behavior will call computed property setters instead of overwriting them.  
We suggest using `Ember.Object.extend()` to create classes and use `create` to initialize
properties on your instance. The old behavior is available via `createWithMixins`.  
This change should increase object creation performance by 2x.

### Other changes of note
`reject` and `rejectProperty` methods have been added to `Ember.Enumerable`.

`Ember.none` and `Ember.empty` have been renamed to `Ember.isEmpty` and `Ember.isNone`
to keep with the Ember Boolean naming convention.


### EmberCamp

The very first Ember Camp in SF is happening on the 15th February 2013.
[Sign up here](https://tito.io/tilde/ember-camp-2013), be quick, tickets are limited.

Looking to learn Ember? There's also an [Introduction to Ember](http://www.embertraining.com/)
event in the week leading up to Ember Camp.

Enjoy your holiday,
