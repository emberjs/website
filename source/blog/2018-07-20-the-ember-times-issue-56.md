## IDEAS
- Edward Faulkner@eaf4
Would you like to use dynamic import() to lazy-load deps into your Ember app right now? Here's a video showing how: https://eaf4.com/dynamic-import-into-your-ember-app/

## [TodoMVC Ember update ‚ú®](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/pull/1790)

On our last edition, we mentioned that [@mixonic](https://github.com/mixonic) was looking for a helping hand to contribute on the TodoMVC Ember.js update. The <a href='https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/pull/1790' target='_blank'>PR</a> is now closed and the bump to Ember 2.13.3 was a success, a big thank you from the community to everyone involved.

TodoMVC helps you decide what MV* framework to use on your projects by providing the classic todo app built in a number of different frameworks and therefore exposing each framework capabilities.

We know which one is our favourite. üêπ

Why not stop by and see it in action <a href='http://todomvc.com/' target='_blank'>here</a> or maybe become a contributor <a href='https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/contributing.md' target='_blank'>here</a>.

Have fun with the "Speed-dating of MV* frameworks"!

## [Got Dependencies? üì¶](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import#dynamic-import)
We‚Äôve previously highlighted the great `ember-auto-import` by the wizard,[Edward Faulkner](https://github.com/ef4) üßô, as a way to import npm packages into your Ember app. With the latest update **it just got way cooler**.

As he demonstrates in this [nice screencast](https://eaf4.com/dynamic-import-into-your-ember-app/) with v1.2.0 you can now lazy load dependencies via `import()`! The dynamic `import()` will load the dependency as well as all its recursive dependencies via a separate Javascript file **at runtime**. That‚Äôs really awesome.

To get started, watch the screencast or dive into the [documentation](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import#dynamic-import).
