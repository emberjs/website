Ia orana Emberistas! üêπ

Read either on the [Ember blog](https://www.emberjs.com/blog/2018/07/20/the-ember-times-issue-56.html) or in our [e-mail newsletter](https://the-emberjs-times.ongoodbits.com/2018/07/20/issue-56) what has been going on in Emberland this week.

...

Check out what's been going in Emberland üêπ these days:

## IDEAS
- Edward Faulkner@eaf4
Would you like to use dynamic import() to lazy-load deps into your Ember app right now? Here's a video showing how: https://eaf4.com/dynamic-import-into-your-ember-app/

## [Got Dependencies? üì¶](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import#dynamic-import)
We‚Äôve previously highlighted the great `ember-auto-import` by the wizard,[Edward Faulkner](https://github.com/ef4) üßô, as a way to import npm packages into your Ember app. With the latest update **it just got way cooler**.

As he demonstrates in this [nice screencast](https://eaf4.com/dynamic-import-into-your-ember-app/) with v1.2.0 you can now lazy load dependencies via `import()`! The dynamic `import()` will load the dependency as well as all its recursive dependencies via a separate Javascript file **at runtime**. That‚Äôs really awesome.

To get started, watch the screencast or dive into the [documentation](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import#dynamic-import).

## [TodoMVC Ember.js Update ‚ú®](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/pull/1790)

On our last edition, we mentioned that [@mixonic](https://github.com/mixonic) was looking for a helping hand to contribute on the TodoMVC Ember.js update. The [PR](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/pull/1790) is now closed and the bump to Ember 2.13.3 was a success, a big thank you from the community to everyone involved.

[TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) helps you decide what MV* framework to use on your projects by providing the classic todo app built in a number of different frameworks and therefore exposing each framework capabilities.

We all know which one is our favorite...üêπ, so why not stop by and see it in action at [http://todomvc.com/emberjs](http://todomvc.com/examples/emberjs), or maybe become a [contributor](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/contributing.md).

Have fun with the "Speed-dating of MV" frameworks"!

## [On the Heels of 3.2: Ember 3.3 Released üéâ](https://emberjs.com/blog/2018/07/16/ember-3-3-released.html)

<img class="float-right small transparent padded" alt="Release Bust Tomster" title="Ember Stable Release" src="/images/tomsters/3-release.png" />

Although you might remember a not too far away, [previous 3.2 release](https://emberjs.com/blog/2018/07/02/ember-3-2-released.html), this week the **latest 3.3 release** of Ember.js, Ember CLI and Ember Data has been [published](https://emberjs.com/blog/2018/07/16/ember-3-3-released.html).
This will guarantee that the publishing of Ember.js in particular stays in sync with the planned schedule of the overall release cycle.

The new minor release of Ember.js includes a switch that allows you to **include _jQuery_** into your app **optionally**,
by using the `jquery-integration` flag of [`@ember/optional-features`](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-optional-features).
There are also some more **new deprecations** that you shouldn't miss to make your Ember app ready for the future! ‚è∞
**Read more** about these and other details of the 3.3 release in [the official release blog post](https://emberjs.com/blog/2018/07/16/ember-3-3-released.html).
