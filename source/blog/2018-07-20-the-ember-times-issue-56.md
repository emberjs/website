## [Got Dependencies? üì¶](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import#dynamic-import)

We‚Äôve previously highlighted the great `ember-auto-import` by the wizardly [Edward Faulkner](https://github.com/ef4)üåü as a way to import npm packages into your Ember app. With the latest update it just got way cooler.

As he demonstrates in this [nice screencast](https://eaf4.com/dynamic-import-into-your-ember-app/), with v1.2.0 you can now lazy load dependencies via `import()`! The dynamic `import()` will load the dependency as well as all its recursive dependencies via a separate JavaScript file **at runtime**. That‚Äôs really awesome.

To get started, watch the screencast or dive into the [documentation](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import#dynamic-import).

## [TodoMVC Ember.js Update ‚ú®](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/pull/1912)

Last week, [@mixonic](https://github.com/mixonic) was looking for a helping hand to contribute to the [TodoMVC Ember.js update](https://twitter.com/mixonic/status/1017487614121684992). The [PR](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/pull/1912) is now merged and the bump to Ember 3.2 was a success. A big thank you from the community to [@zoltan-nz](https://github.com/zoltan-nz) and everyone involved.

[TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) helps you decide what MV* framework to use for your projects by providing the classic todo app built in a number of different frameworks and therefore exposing each frameworks' capabilities.

We all know which one is our favorite...üêπ, so why not stop by and see it in action at [http://todomvc.com/emberjs](http://todomvc.com/examples/emberjs), or maybe become a [contributor](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/contributing.md) yourself.

Have fun with the "Speed-dating of MV" frameworks"!

<img class="float-right small transparent padded" alt="Release Bust Tomster" title="Ember Stable Release" src="/images/tomsters/3-release.png" />

Although you might remember a not too far away, [previous 3.2 release](https://emberjs.com/blog/2018/07/02/ember-3-2-released.html), this week the **latest 3.3 releases** of Ember.js, Ember CLI and Ember Data have been [published](https://emberjs.com/blog/2018/07/16/ember-3-3-released.html).
This will guarantee that the publishing of Ember.js in particular stays in sync with the planned schedule of the overall release cycle.

The new minor release of Ember.js includes several **new deprecations** that you shouldn't miss to make your Ember app ready for the future! ‚è∞
**Read more** about these and other details of the 3.3 release in [the official release blog post](https://emberjs.com/blog/2018/07/16/ember-3-3-released.html).
