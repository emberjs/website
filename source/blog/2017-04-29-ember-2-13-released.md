Today the Ember project is releasing version 2.13.0 of Ember.js, Ember Data, and Ember CLI.

This release kicks off the 2.14 beta cycle for all sub-projects. We encourage our
community (especially addon authors) to help test these beta builds and report
any bugs before they are published as a final release in six weeks' time. The
[ember-try](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try) addon is a great way to
continuously test your projects against the latest Ember releases.

## Ember.js

Ember.js is the core framework for building ambitious web applications.

### Changes in Ember.js 2.13

Building on the addition of `factoryFor` in Ember 2.12, Ember 2.13 changes
the way dependency injection is implemented in the framework. Until 2.12,
dependencies were injected onto an instance using `extend` to create a subclass.
This created an excessive number of subclasses during the execution of an
application. In Ember 2.13 injections are passed to an object via `create`
during instantiation. This results in a notable performance improvement
that grows in impact with the complexity of an application.

See [RFC #150](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0150-factory-for.md)
and pull request [#14360](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/14360) for
more details about this change.

Additionally, this release contains a further refinement on the "binary VM"
change landed in 2.12. By using integers for common Glimmer wire-format strings,
compiled template sizes in 2.13 will see an incremental size reduction.

In addition to these and other improvements, several changes arising
from the [RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs) process have been implemented:

- [RFC issue #146](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/issues/146) advocated for the
  addition of `resumeTest` as a compliment to `pauseTest`. This was implemented
  in [#13663](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/13663).
- [RFC #186](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0186-track-unique-history-location-state.md)
  describes the addition of `uuid` as a property on `HistoryLocation` adapters
  for the router. This addition makes it possible to track scroll locations
  to a point in browsing history. See pull request [#14011](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/14011)
  for more details.

#### Deprecations in Ember 2.13

A bit of cleanup has been done to reduce confusion (during implementation of the [router service](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0095-router-service.md)) which resulted in adding a deprecation for accessing the private `router` property
of the router. This property has always been private API, but a number of addons have resorted to
using it due to lack of public API options (though the router service should address these remaining
cases). Please review the [deprecation guide](https://emberjs.com/deprecations/v2.x/#toc_ember-router-router-renamed-to-ember-router-_routermicrolib)
for more details.

For more details on the changes in Ember.js 2.13, please review the
[Ember.js 2.13.0 release page](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/releases/tag/v2.13.0).

### Upcoming Changes in Ember.js 2.14

Ember 2.14 is shaping up to be largely a bugfix release, containing a significant amount of internal cleanup.

For more details on the upcoming changes in Ember.js 2.14, please review the
[Ember.js 2.14.0-beta.1 release page](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/releases/tag/v2.14.0-beta.1).

## Ember Data

Ember Data is the official data persistence library for Ember.js applications.

### Changes in Ember Data 2.13

Ember Data 2.13 represents the work of 20 direct contributors
and over 120 commits.

The `ds-extended-errors` ([#3586](https://github.com/emberjs/data/pull/3586) [#4287](https://github.com/emberjs/data/pull/4287)) feature has been enabled for Ember Data 2.13.

This feature introduces an `extend` method on errors which allows
users to create their own custom errors that extend from
`DS.AdapterError`.

```js
const MyCustomError = DS.AdapterError.extend({ message: "My custom error." });
```

The feature also introduces some new errors to the REST adapter which will
be used to reject the adapter promises based on http status of the API
response.

* [401] `DS.UnauthorizedError`
* [403] `DS.ForbiddenError`
* [404] `DS.NotFoundError`
* [409] `DS.ConflictError`
* [500] `DS.ServerError`

Thanks to [tchak](https://github.com/tchak) and
[twokul](https://github.com/twokul) for their work on this feature and
[lindyhopchris](https://github.com/lindyhopchris) for his help
documenting the feature.

#### Deprecations in Ember Data 2.13

Ember Data 2.13 deprecates the `data-adapter`, `injectStore`,
`transforms`, and `store` Ember application initializers that Ember Data injects
into apps. The deprecation was proposed via [an RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0181-deprecate-ember-data-initializers.md),
and the Ember Data team proactively submitted pull-requests for all usages of
these initializers in open source addons. 

For more details on the changes in Ember Data 2.13, please review the
[Ember Data 2.13.0 release page](https://github.com/emberjs/data/releases/tag/v2.13.0).

### Upcoming changes in Ember Data 2.14

In 2.14, Ember Data continues its internal refactorings and performance work without
impacting public APIs. It is shaping up nicely with reduced asset size (~ 3KB savings),
better warnings and errors around malformed JSONAPI payloads, and simplified internals.

#### Deprecations in Ember Data 2.14

Ember Data 2.14
[deprecates](https://github.com/emberjs/data/pull/4909/files) the
private method `didUpdateAll`. If you are using it in your codebase
please use the updated methods name `_didUpdateAll`.

For more details on the upcoming changes in Ember Data 2.14, please review the
[Ember Data 2.14.0-beta.1 release page](https://github.com/emberjs/data/releases/tag/v2.14.0-beta.1).

## Ember CLI

Ember CLI is the command line interface for managing and packaging Ember.js
applications.

### Upgrading Ember CLI

You may upgrade Ember CLI separately from Ember.js and Ember Data! To upgrade
your projects using `yarn` run:

```
yarn upgrade ember-cli
```

To upgrade your projects using `npm` run:

```
npm install --save-dev ember-cli
```

After running the
upgrade command run `ember init` inside of the project directory to apply the
blueprint changes. You can preview those changes for [applications](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-new-output/compare/v2.12.0...v2.13.0)
and [addons](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-addon-output/compare/v2.12.0...v2.13.0).

### Changes in Ember CLI 2.13

#### Add support for using `yarn`

Ember CLI projects have been able to utilize `yarn` for dependency management for quite some time, however it was not well supported by
the default generators. In 2.13, Ember CLI is now "yarn aware", and will use `yarn` for tasks such as `ember install` if it detects that
`yarn` is installed and a `yarn.lock` exists in the project. You can even instruct `ember new` to generate a new project with a `yarn.lock`
for you via `ember new foo --yarn`.

#### Enable Instrumentation Hooks

Ember CLI has had the ability to generate custom instrumentation output for builds for a few years now (introduced on 2015-08-24), but
this information has not been readily accessible. In 2.13, ember-cli exposes this information to addons that implement the `instrumentation`
hook. This allows addons to access many things that were previously very difficult (e.g. reliable build time reporting).

Thanks to [@hjdivad](https://github.com/hjdivad) for proposing and implementing this feature. Please read through [the RFC](https://github.com/ember-cli/rfcs/blob/master/complete/0091-addon-instrumentation-experimental-hooks.md)
for more details.

#### Targets

In order to allow addons to understand the desired target platforms of the app that they are operating in, a new file has been added
to all generated projects: `config/targets.js`. This file exposes the supported targets so that tooling such as [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) 
and [babel-preset-env](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env) can properly understand the level of transpilation that is needed.

Thanks to [@cibernox](https://github.com/cibernox) for proposing and implementing this feature. [@rwjblue](https://github.com/rwjblue) 
recently wrote a blog post reviewing the new feature and how to utilize it: [Ember CLI Targets](http://rwjblue.com/2017/04/21/ember-cli-targets/).

#### Babel 6

Babel 6 support has been added to Ember CLI internally and is now used by default for newly generated projects (both applications and addons).
Due to the way that Ember CLI handles transpilation this transition can be done gradually by updating each addon to utilize newer versions of
[ember-cli-babel](https://github.com/babel/ember-cli-babel). Updating your application to start using Babel 6 for its own transpilation is as simple as:

```sh
# if using yarn:
yarn upgrade ember-cli-babel@6

# if using npm:
npm install --save-dev ember-cli-babel@6
```

#### Other Notable Changes

* `bower.json` is no longer included in a newly generated project.
* Fix command interruption issues on windows.
* Added `filesToRemove` property for custom blueprints.

For more details on the changes in Ember CLI 2.13 and detailed upgrade
instructions, please review the [Ember CLI 2.13.0 release page](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/releases/tag/v2.13.0).

### Upcoming Changes in Ember CLI 2.14

In Ember CLI 2.14, support was added to `ember new` to allow a blueprint to be consumed from an NPM package. This enables projects to utilize Ember CLI's
ergonomics to generate non-Ember applications. Common examples of this are:

- Generate a new [Glimmer.js](https://glimmerjs.com/) application. See [glimmerjs/glimmer-blueprint](https://github.com/glimmerjs/glimmer-blueprint).
- Generate a new [ember-cli-deploy](http://ember-cli-deploy.com/) plugin. See [ember-cli-deploy/plugin-blueprint](https://github.com/ember-cli-deploy/plugin-blueprint).


These can be used as simply as:

```
npm install -g ember-cli@2.14.0-beta.1
ember new ember-cli-deploy-hello -b @ember-cli-deploy/plugin-blueprint
```

For more details on the changes in Ember CLI 2.14.0-beta.1 and detailed upgrade
instructions, please review the [Ember CLI 2.14.0-beta.1 release page](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/releases/tag/v2.14.0-beta.1).

## Thank You!

As a community-driven open-source project with an ambitious scope, each of
these releases serve as a reminder that the Ember project would not have been
possible without your continued support. We are extremely grateful to our
contributors for their efforts.
