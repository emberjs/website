## [First Annual DecEmber Event! ‚ùÑÔ∏è](https://emberjs.com/blog/2018/11/29/december-event.html)

This year, the Ember Learning Core Team is sponsoring our first annual DecEmber, a hackathon event specifically targeted at Learning Team efforts! For an extra bit of awesome, it‚Äôs running at the same time as [24 Pull Requests](https://24pullrequests.com/), so contributions to DecEmber will count for both!

Maybe December is a busy month for you, because of the holidays and family obligations‚Äîand that‚Äôs totally okay‚Äîwe hope you have a great time! But for some, December is a time of the year with a lot of downtime. Maybe that‚Äôs you! Are you wondering what to do with all your vacation time in December? We‚Äôve got ya covered!

**Participation Rules**

To qualify for any of our random assortment of thank you goodies (that we‚Äôve delightfully dubbed _Embercouragement_), you must complete at least five participation activities for repositories in the [ember-learn org](https://github.com/ember-learn) between December 1-28, 2018.

**Participation Activities**

- Submitting PRs for issues
  - In the [Ember Learn org](https://github.com/ember-learn)
  - That have the `DecEmber` label
- Writing Issues for repositories in the ember-learn org. We will mark them with the `DecEmber` label if they qualify.
- Creating Illustrations: Maybe you have an artistic side, and illustrating code concepts is fun for you! If that‚Äôs the case, there are always illustrations that would enhance the guides, and those are very welcome for this event!
- If you have another idea that you think would help support the Learning Core Team, let us know!

**Quality Standards**

We don‚Äôt think we need to say these things, but just in case‚Ä¶

- The PR counts once it is merged; the issue counts once we have added the label.
- The PR must not be disruptive (i.e., taking someone else‚Äôs branch/commits and creating a PR).
- If you participate by writing an issue, the issue should be of respectable quality and not something that is clearly an intent to +1 your participation count.

**Support**

During the month of December, members of the Learning Core Team will be spending extra time in the December [text](https://discordapp.com/channels/480462759797063690/517914929261576212) and [voice chat](https://discordapp.com/channels/480462759797063690/517914929261576212) channels on our [Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/zT3asNS)! It's a great place to ask questions or chat about the event.

## [New Guides for Ember CLI üìì](https://cli.emberjs.com/release/)
There's a **new and improved version of the Ember CLI guides out**. [@jenweber](https://github.com/jenweber) has been championing moving the Ember CLI guides into the Ember domain with enhanced content.

There will be a more formal launch of the new Ember CLI guides on the [Ember blog](https://emberjs.com/blog/) but since you're **an Ember Times subscriber**, [you get a sneak peek](https://cli.emberjs.com/release/).

If you find any typos or bugs, then please feel free to report it to the [new repository](https://github.com/ember-learn/cli-guides).

## [The RFC RFCeption ü§î](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/300)
<!--alex ignore period-->
The RFC (Request For Comments) about the [RFC Process](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/300) itself is in its **final comment period**!

The current RFC process is great but has a few quirks. For example, there are different processes for [emberjs/rfcs](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs) and [ember-cli/rfcs](https://github.com/ember-cli/rfcs). If you haven't taken a look yet; this RFC proposes joining together all RFC processes, requiring a [core team](https://emberjs.com/team/) champion for RFCs that are accepted and more. Check it out and join the [discussion](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/300)!

## [Have You Read the Ember Subreddit? ‚¨ÜÔ∏è](https://www.reddit.com/r/emberjs/)
In case you didn't know Ember.js has its own [Reddit subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/emberjs/)! It is another media channel where people can participate and share **Ember-related** things! It recently got a facelift and a new Ember brand theme.

The community has decided that we want to revive this subreddit and get it active. We want to get something about Ember on the front page but we need your help!

If you are wondering where to start check out [What Are You Working On (Nov 2018)](https://www.reddit.com/r/emberjs/comments/9yycbi/what_are_you_working_on_nov_2018/) and tell us what Ember things you have been doing in the month of November.

If you have any questions about the subreddit itself or want to help out hit up the new mods [@NullVoxPopuli](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli) or [@Alon](https://github.com/Alonski) on [Discord](https://discord.gg/zT3asNS).

So **subscribe** to the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/emberjs/) today, post some content and upvote üÜô what you love!
