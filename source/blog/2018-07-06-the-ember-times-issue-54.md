## [QUnit DOM on TypeScript for Easy-Peasy Assertions](https://github.com/simplabs/qunit-dom/pull/96)

Are you fond of writing tests in QUnit? Are you a fan of expressive test assertions? Do you 💙 **TypeScript**?
Then we'll guarantee you that this update to [qunit-dom](https://github.com/simplabs/qunit-dom) -
a library that helps you to write **high-level DOM assertions** - will make your heart beat faster 💕:

The library is now using TypeScript for compilation to ES5 and features lots of new type declarations,
making it possible for you to explore the [API](https://github.com/simplabs/qunit-dom/blob/master/API.md)
in your editor as you type.

Check out the [latest v0.7 release](https://github.com/simplabs/qunit-dom/blob/v0.7.0/CHANGELOG.md) to
get all the TypeScript neatness to your test suite today and type on! ⌨
