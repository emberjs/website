Hey there Emberistas!

Lots of Ember programmers and writers have been busy this week! We have several new data-driven RFCs (üìù Requests for Comments), community efforts, and an outstanding update to Ember inspector to present to you.

As well as a sincere reminder to eat your veggies! ü•íü•ï

## [I hope my build never lets me down again in Ember üêπ](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/328)

Have you ever made a change in the source code of your Ember app and subsequently awaited
the reload of your app's browser tab, to no avail?
Seconds, minutes, a coffee later‚Äîyou might have checked your terminal window‚Äîthen at last, you find that syntax error in your template
that led to a failing build, preventing the reload.

This week's RFC proposes the automatic inclusion of **<i>ember-cli-build-notifications</i>**
into new Ember apps. It's an addon providing system notifications for failing Ember app builds by default.

The RFC proposal also discusses several alternative techniques to improve developer ergonomics regarding
app builds. If you're curious, check out the [full RFC here](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/328)
and leave your thoughts on it!

## [Listen to your Broccoli and it will tell you how to eat it](http://www.oligriffiths.com/broccolijs/)

You might already know that Broccoli takes care of your asset pipeline. But do you know **how** it works? [Oli Griffiths](https://twitter.com/oligriffiths) has made an [amazing tutorial](http://www.oligriffiths.com/broccolijs/) on *the asset pipeline for ambitious applications*. It takes you through the basic setup and guides you through the journey of sass preprocessing, debugging and fingerprints.

## [Spring cleaning for Ember Data powered by RFCs üìüüêπ](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/329)

A particular RFC has entered the final comment period with incredible speed!
It proposes the **deprecation** of <em>ember-data</em>'s `Array.filter` method and explains
how this change will not only improve the maintainability of the
<i>ember-data</i> project, but also improve the **performance** of Ember apps.

You can [read the full RFC here](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/326) and
leave your comments for it.

If you're making use of `this.get('store').filter` in your app or addon,
check out the documentation of the <i>ember-data-filter</i> addon and
follow the dedicated [guide on how to refactor this easily](https://github.com/ember-data/ember-data-filter#recommended-refactor-guide).

In other <i>ember-data</i> news, another proposal focuses on removing usage of the `Ember.Evented` mixin
in <i>ember-data</i> specifically.
This would also lead to the future removal of several lifecycle hooks and methods
on `Model`s and other Ember Data classes. You can learn more about
the design of this proposed deprecation in [the original RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/329).

This week, contributors to Ember Data focused on getting some [cleanup
work](https://github.com/emberjs/data/pull/5459) underway to leave the
soon-to-be deprecated `store.filter` behind for good.
Finally, a [bug fix](https://github.com/emberjs/data/pull/5461) for breaking up async relationships has landed. ‚ú®
