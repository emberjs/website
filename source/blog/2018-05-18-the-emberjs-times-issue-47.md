안녕하세요 Emberistas!

Again you can enjoy reading the Ember.js Times in both the [e-mail](https://the-emberjs-times.ongoodbits.com/2018/05/18/issue-47) and the [blog format](https://emberjs.com/blog/2018/05/18/the-emberjs-times-issue-47.html) to share it even better with your Ember friends.

This week we have **several RFCs** from the Ember Data 📟 project for you, as well as an **#EmberJS2018 countdown**, a new way to cast some **template transform magic** 🎩 and a recap of what has happened in Readers' Questions for you:

---

## [Meta and Link all the Things in Ember Data 🐹](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/332)

This backwards compatible Request for Comments (RFC) allows `ember-data` users to associate optional `meta` and `links` on **records** alongside the top-level document `meta` (mandatory) and `links` (optional).  Sadly, `ember-data` currently stores this information only on relationships and not individual records.  

The RFC design is pretty straightforward and proposes that all `meta` and `links`:

- will be honored in any resource that is part of a [JSON API compliant](http://jsonapi.org/) document
- when defined on resource identifiers (e.g. links inside a relationhip that link to other resources) will be ignored
- when defined on relationship objects will continue to function as they do today
- will be exposed as getters on instances of `DS.Model` and will default to null if nothing has been provided

Similarly, `meta` and `links` will be exposed on instances of `DS.Snapshot`. Although `meta` and `links` are getters on `DS.Model`s, they will be exposed on `DS.Snapshot` as methods:

```js
class Snapshot {
    links() {}
	meta() {}
}
```

Interestingly, some apps have inadvertently achieved what this RFC purposes by moving `meta` and `links` into `attributes` during serialization and then exposing each of them via `DS.attr`. 
Therefore, this RFC gives `ember-data` an even more **complete "out of the box experience"** and will likely be a very welcomed addition to the library.  

Think differently? Tell [@runspired](https://github.com/runspired) what you think on the [original proposal](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/332).

## [More Ember Data: RFC for removing `Ember.Evented`](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/329)

There's an RFC on removing usage of the `Ember.Evented` mixin in Ember Data specifically. This would also lead to the future **removal** of several **lifecycle hooks** and methods on `Model`s and other Ember Data classes.

The use of `Ember.Evented` is mostly a legacy from pre 1.0 of Ember Data and is simply not needed anymore. 
You can **follow the discussion** and read all about the implications of this change on the [RFC pull request](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/329).

## [Recasting Call 🎬 for Templates](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-recast)

<div class="blog-row">

<p>Are you an Ember addon author who wants to be able to <strong>transform the template</strong> of host apps? Or are you an Ember developer who tinkers with templates or template-related codemods? Then, the new Ember addon <a href="https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-recast" target="recast">ember-template-recast</a> is just for you.</p>

<p>Ember Template Recast will allow you to transform templates easily in a <strong>non-destructive manner</strong> - this means, that you can modify specific parts of your templates while preserving everything else - incl. whitespace formatting and linebreaks - from your original template.</p>
</div>

The `templateRecast` API offers you methods for creating abstract syntax trees (AST) from your templates and vice versa and a way to [traverse](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-recast#traverse) your templates and modify them along the way.

See it in action:

```js
const { transform } = require('ember-template-recast');

const template = `
{{my-component
  title="I less than 3 ember-template-recast"
}}
`;

let { code } = transform(template, env => {
  let { builders: b } = env.syntax;

  return {
    MustacheStatement() {
      return b.mustache(b.path('wat-wat'));
    },
  };
});

// ...et voilà, enjoy a modified template string 💁🏻
console.log(code); // => {{wat-wat}}
```

<p>The project is still cutting-edge experimental 👨🏾‍🔬, <del> but </del> and therefore pretty exciting! Try it out for yourself <a href="https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-recast" target="recast">here</a> and transform your templates today.✨</p>
