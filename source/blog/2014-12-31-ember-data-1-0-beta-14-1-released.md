Ember Data v1.0.0-beta.14.1 is a bugfix release that adds sourcemaps
to your build pipeline in Ember CLI and Rails. Additionally support
for versions of Ember <= 1.7.1 have been removed. This was mentioned
in the [beta.12 blogpost][beta12], and is now enforced via an assertion
in the code and by your package manager files.
