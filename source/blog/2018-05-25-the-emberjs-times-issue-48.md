## [What is your wish for Ember in 2018?](https://emberjs.com/blog/2018/05/02/ember-2018-roadmap-call-for-posts.html)
There‚Äôs a week left of the Ember‚Äôs 2018 call for blog posts. There‚Äôs already been a lot of great blog posts from the community, but we‚Äôre hoping for more!

Write a blog post by **May 30th** to propose goals and direction for Ember in the remainder of 2018. The content of these posts will help the core team to draft their first Roadmap RFC.

Looking for inspiration? Check out the [#EmberJS2018 hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23EmberJS2018) on Twitter or [@zinyado‚Äôs repo collection posts](https://github.com/zinyando/emberjs2018-posts) on GitHub.

## [Updates to the ember-cli-addon-docs](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-cli-addon-docs)

It‚Äôs becoming harder to have an excuse to not document your software libraries as the AddonDocs is getting easier to use by the day.

A real-world example of its usage is the the ember-decorators documentation: <a href='http://ember-decorators.github.io/ember-decorators/latest/docs' target='_blank'>ember-decorators</a>, which was recently revamped by leveraging the add-on, have a go at it and inspire yourself to your own documentation.

Also, on the most recent releases, the following neatest features were made available:

- new version selector: good news for when you feel nostalgic about old documentation. Now you can add to your navigation a version selector control that will enable you to jump back and forth to different documentation versions with ease, check it out <a href='https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-cli-addon-docs/pull/156' target='_blank'>here</a>.

- "Magic mirror, on the wall ‚Äì who is the most beautiful documentation of all?" The AddonDocs has an even prettier UI now thanks to the `ember-cli-tailwind`, if you are unfamiliar with Tailwind, do yourself a favour and deep dive into its power <a href='https://tailwindcss.com/' target='_blank'>here</a>.
