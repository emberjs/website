## [Updates to the ember-cli-addon-docs](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-cli-addon-docs)

It’s becoming harder to have an excuse to not document your software libraries as the AddonDocs is getting easier to use by the day.

A real-world example of its usage is the the ember-decorators documentation: <a href='http://ember-decorators.github.io/ember-decorators/latest/docs' target='_blank'>ember-decorators</a>, which was recently revamped by leveraging the add-on, have a go at it and inspire yourself to your own documentation.

Also, on the most recent releases, the following neatest features were made available:

- new version selector: good news for when you feel nostalgic about old documentation. Now you can add to your navigation a version selector control that will enable you to jump back and forth to different documentation versions with ease, check it out <a href='https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-cli-addon-docs/pull/156' target='_blank'>here</a>.

- "Magic mirror, on the wall – who is the most beautiful documentation of all?" The AddonDocs has an even prettier UI now thanks to the `ember-cli-tailwind`, if you are unfamiliar with Tailwind, do yourself a favour and deep dive into its power <a href='https://tailwindcss.com/' target='_blank'>here</a>.
