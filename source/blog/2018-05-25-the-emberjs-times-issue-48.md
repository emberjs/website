## [What is your wish for Ember in 2018?🌟](https://emberjs.com/blog/2018/05/02/ember-2018-roadmap-call-for-posts.html)
There’s a week left of the Ember’s 2018 call for blog posts. There’s already been a lot of great blog posts from the community, but we’re hoping for more!

Write a blog post by **May 30th** to propose goals and direction for Ember in the remainder of 2018. The content of these posts will help the core team to draft their first Roadmap RFC.

Looking for inspiration? Check out the [#EmberJS2018 hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23EmberJS2018) on Twitter or [@zinyado’s repo collection posts](https://github.com/zinyando/emberjs2018-posts) on GitHub.

## [A Package out for delivery to Ember CLI 📦♥︎🐹](#your-url-here)

Recently, lots of work has landed 🛬 in Ember CLI to bring the long-awaited **Packager feature** to life ([1](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/7826), [2](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/7818), [3](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/7816), [4](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/7796), [5](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/7788)). The Packager will increase the **flexibility** of Ember's **build pipeline**, paving the way for other neat features like code splitting and tree shaking and finally allowing developers to further reduce the filesize of their applications by dramatic amounts.

Want a recap of what's in for the Packager feature? Be sure to check out both the  the [original RFC (Request for Comments) proposal](https://github.com/chadhietala/rfcs/blob/packager/active/0002-packager.md), as well as [this year's update](https://github.com/ember-cli/rfcs/blob/master/active/0051-packaging.md) that details the motivation behind it.
And want to know **when** it will finally land for an Ember app near you? Of course we'll let you know asap 🔜 in one of the upcoming editions of the Ember.js Times!

## [Shiny new ember-cli-addon-docs ✨](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-cli-addon-docs)

It’s becoming harder to have an excuse to not document your software libraries as the `ember-cli-addon-docs` are getting easier to use day-by-day.

A real-world example of its usage is the `ember-decorators` documentation: <a href='http://ember-decorators.github.io/ember-decorators/latest/docs' target='_blank'>ember-decorators</a>, which was recently revamped by leveraging the add-on. Have a go at it and inspire yourself 👩‍🎨 to your own documentation!

Also, on the most recent releases, the following neatest features were made available:

- New **version selector**: good news for when you feel nostalgic about old documentation. Now you can add to your navigation a version selector control that will enable you to jump back and forth to different documentation versions with ease, check it out <a href='https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-cli-addon-docs/pull/156' target='_blank'>here</a>.

- _"Magic mirror, on the wall – who is the most beautiful documentation of all?"_: `ember-cli-addon-docs` has an even **prettier UI** now thanks to `ember-cli-tailwind`. If you are unfamiliar with Tailwind, do yourself a favour and deep dive into its power <a href='https://tailwindcss.com/' target='_blank'>here</a>.
