## [Everyone's Moved! 📦 Meet Your Ember 🐹 Friends On Discord 🗣](https://discord.gg/zT3asNS)

It's done! 👌 The **community chat has** finally **moved** over to [Discord](https://discordapp.com/)!
Even more **modern** than _IRC_ and _ICQ_ combined, you can now chat with other Emberistas from all around the globe in many different topic channels with **unlimited message history** 💌✨.

[Join today](https://discord.gg/zT3asNS)) and be sure to get setup as described in the `#setup-profile` channel. To start chatting, request the _community-member_ role in `#discord-server-admin`, so the undaunted org admins can make sure THAT YOU ARE NOT A BOT BUT A REAL HUMAN JUST LIKE US HA-HA 🤖.

## [A Public Factory 🏭 For Your Models ](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/372)

A brand-new 🔥 **Request For Comments (RFC)** makes addon authors' and Ember power users' 💪 hearts ♡ leap for joy:
The previously [deprecated Ember Data `store` method `modelFactoryFor`](https://github.com/emberjs/data/blob/v3.3.1/addon/-private/system/store.js#L2083) is making its comeback as an official, **public API**.
This new public method will allow users to provide any kind of `ModelClass` (and not only the default `DS.Model` provided by Ember Data) to applications if needed.

Curious? [**Read the full proposal**](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/372) and leave your questions and suggestions in the comments below!
