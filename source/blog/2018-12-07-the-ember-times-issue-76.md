## [Tracked Properties RFC Is Up for Review! 👣](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/410)

The [Tracked Properties RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/be351b059f08ac0fe709bc7697860d5064717a7f/text/0000-tracked-properties.md) introduces a simpler and more ergonomic system for tracking state change in Ember applications.

Developers can identify if a property or a getter should be _autotracked_  by adding a `@tracked` decorator to it. This allows that value to have its dependencies automatically detected as it is used.

Because tracked properties are just a very thin layer on top of native JavaScript, setting and accessing tracked properties can be done using **standard JavaScript syntax**. With no special syntax, and leveraging existing JavaScript knowledge.

Comment and read more about the [RFC on GitHub](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/410).

## [Ten Minutes to Improve JavaScript 📈](https://www.npmjs.com/2018-javascript-ecosystem-survey)

Represent Ember in the [2018 JavaScript Ecosystem Survey](https://www.npmjs.com/2018-javascript-ecosystem-survey)! 

Each winter, [npm, Inc.](https://www.npmjs.com/) circulates a survey of software developers and npm users to solicit your feedback and ideas about how to continue supporting the world’s fastest growing developer community and the world’s most popular development language. (Review last year’s results [here](https://www.npmjs.com/npm/state-of-javascript-frameworks-2017-part-1).) Be sure to fill out the survey [here](https://www.npmjs.com/2018-javascript-ecosystem-survey) in order to share what you've been working on and how you plan to use JavaScript in 2019. And spread the word!

## [JSON:API Update 1.1 🇯](https://twitter.com/jsonapi/status/1069593631365959680)

**JSON:API 1.1 RC1** is released! 🎉🎊🎈 The spec will hopefully be finalized by January 31 which is very exciting! If you use JSON:API and are able to, try out the upcoming version and give some feedback.

One notable feature is the addition of **"profiles"** which allow specifying addition semantics on top of the current spec. This could allow specifying things like filtering, pagination and more. Check out [profiles here](https://jsonapi.org/extensions/).

Another noteworthy change is the official recommendation to use camelCase for resource fields. This standardization will allow composing and parsing **JSON:API** with JavaScript and other languages. Check it out [here](https://jsonapi.org/recommendations/#naming).

To learn more about the rest of the features and changes in **JSON:API 1.1** check out the [Update History](https://jsonapi.org/#update-history).
