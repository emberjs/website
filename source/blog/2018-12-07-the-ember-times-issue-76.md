## [Tracked Properties RFC is up for review! üë£](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/410)

The [Tracked Properties RFC](https://github.com/tomdale/rfcs/blob/5710d6e6fdc4ae283af7259800beb18aecb95c0d/text/0000-tracked-properties.md) introduces a simpler and more ergonomic system for tracking state change in Ember applications.

Developers can identify if a property or a getter should be _autotracked_  by adding a `@tracked` decorator to it. This allows that value to have its dependencies automatically detected as it is used. 

Because tracked properties are just a very thin layer on top of native JavaScript, setting and accessing tracked properties can be done using **standard JavaScript syntax**. With no special syntax, and leveraging existing JavaScript knowledge.

Comment and read more about the [RFC on GitHub](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/410).
