## [Find Ways to Help Out with the Ember Help Wanted App&nbsp;‚ú®](https://help-wanted.emberjs.com)

Too much spare time at hand and don't know what to do? Wanna **contribute to open-source**? Then check out the sparkling ‚ú® [new **Ember Help Wanted App**](https://help-wanted.emberjs.com) ‚ú®!!

The Ember Help Wanted App lists all current open issues across Ember repositories, like Ember CLI, Ember Data, the EmberJS Website and more which could use some support. The website is also a great resource if you're still looking forward to get your contributions in for [**Hacktoberfest**](https://www.emberjs.com/blog/2018/10/05/the-ember-times-issue-67.html#toc_a-href-https-hacktoberfest-digitalocean-com-hacktoberfest-a), so be sure to [check it out](https://help-wanted.emberjs.com).

## [EmberConf 2019 Call for Papers üìù](https://emberconf.com/become-a-speaker.html)

Huzzah, the announcement is here! EmberConf 2019 will be held **March 18-20** in Portland, OR! [EmberConf](https://emberconf.com/index.html) is three days of activities, sessions, talks and trainings with the Ember Core Team and community members from around the world.

<!--alex ignore blind-->
EmberConf is great because its speakers are great, **and you could be one of them!** The Call for Papers is public, starts out blind, and features a collaborative process to help applicants improve their proposals. Proposals will be accepted and reviewed from now until **November 18, 2018**.

Don't forget to check out [#ember-conf](https://discordapp.com/channels/480462759797063690/480502413917421570) on the [Ember Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/zT3asNS)!

## [Quest: Write the MVP of the New Ember CLI Guides ‚ú®](https://github.com/ember-learn/cli-guides-source/issues/3)

Looking for your next challenge? We‚Äôre looking for contributors to help port over and rewrite content from [ember-cli.com](https://ember-cli.com/) as outlined in the [RFC](https://github.com/ember-cli/rfcs/pull/120).

_Choose a task, any task ‚Äì we‚Äôve got you covered!_ There are **plenty of opportunities to contribute** from picking a markdown file without any content and simply adding suggested headings to it ‚Äì to completely working on a greenfield rewrite of the [deployments section](https://ember-cli.com/user-guide/#deployments). The idea is to empower new contributors by having up-to-date and clear documentation with the goal of wrapping up the **MVP by the end of 2018**.

See the full list on the [cli-guides-source Quest issue](https://github.com/ember-learn/cli-guides-source/issues/3)!

## [Module Unification Is in the Final Stretch! üõ£](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16373)

Have you heard of **Ember's future default project layout**? If you haven't, you can read about it the [Module Unification RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0143-module-unification.md).

The initial work on Module Unification is **nearly complete**, as **[there are only a handful of tasks left](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16373)** and some of the tasks just need a good amount of spelunking time.
If you can donate some of your time to help finish this up, the entire community will forever be in your debt. üíñ

Also, if you are a user of namespaced components, [this RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/367) is a must read. Please leave your thoughts on the [Module Unification Packages RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/367) as nested components affect the majority of Ember projects.

To learn more about Module Unification, feel free to join the [#st-module-unification channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/480462759797063690/484527343331704832) on the [Ember Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/zT3asNS)!

Curious what a real project looks like with module unifcation?
