## [EmberConf 2019 Call for Papers üìù](https://emberconf.com/become-a-speaker.html)

The gathering of the uniquely ambitious is announced! EmberConf 2019 will be held **March 18-20** in Portland, OR! [EmberConf](https://emberconf.com/index.html) is three days of activities, sessions, talks and trainings with the Ember Core Team and community members from around the world. 

<!--alex ignore blind-->
EmberConf is great because its speakers are great, **and you could be one of them!** The Call for Papers is public, starts out blind, and features a collaborative process to help applicants improve their proposals. Proposals will be accepted and reviewed from now until **November 18, 2018**. 

Don't forget to check out [#ember-conf](https://discordapp.com/channels/480462759797063690/480502413917421570) on the [Ember Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/zT3asNS)!

## [Quest: Write the MVP of New ember-cli-guides ‚ú®](https://github.com/ember-learn/cli-guides-source/issues/3)

Looking for your next challenge? We‚Äôre looking for contributors to help port over and rewrite content from [ember-cli.com](https://ember-cli.com/) as outlined in the [RFC](https://github.com/ember-cli/rfcs/pull/120).

_Choose a task, any task ‚Äì we‚Äôve got you covered!_ There are **plenty of opportunities to contribute** from picking a markdown file without any content and simply adding suggested headings to it ‚Äì to completely working on a greenfield rewrite of the [deployments section](https://ember-cli.com/user-guide/#deployments). The idea is to empower new contributors by having up-to-date and clear documentation with the goal of wrapping up the **MVP by the end of 2018**.

See the full list on the [cli-guides-source Quest issue](https://github.com/ember-learn/cli-guides-source/issues/3)!

## [Module Unification Is in the Final Stretch! üõ£](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16373)
Have you heard of **Ember's future default project layout**? If you haven't, you can read about it the [Module Unification RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0143-module-unification.md). 

The initial work on Module Unification is **nearly complete**, as **[there are only a handful of tasks left](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16373)** and some of the tasks just need a good amount of spelunking time.
If you can donate some of your time to help finish this up, the entire community will forever be in your debt. üíñ

Also, if you are a user of namespaced components, [this RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/367) is a must read. Please leave your thoughts on the [Module Unification Packages RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/367) as nested components affect the majority of Ember projects.

To learn more about Module Unification, feel free to join the [#st-module-unification channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/480462759797063690/484527343331704832) on the [Ember Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/zT3asNS)!
