## [Release of ember-ajax v5.0.0 🎉](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-ajax/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#500-2019-03-05)

[@Turbo87](https://github.com/turbo87/) announced the [release of version 5.0.0](https://twitter.com/TobiasBieniek/status/1103051224180498434) of [ember-ajax](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-ajax). In this update, we have a **breaking change** for the Error classes since the base class of the custom Error classes was changed to extend native `Error` instead of `EmberError`. 

Furthermore, ember-ajax was also updated to use [ember-cli-babel](https://github.com/babel/ember-cli-babel) v7.x, which requires all apps that uses ember-ajax to use [Ember CLI 2.13 or above](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-ajax#compatibility).
