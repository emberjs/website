## [Release of ember-ajax v5.0.0 🎉](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-ajax/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#500-2019-03-05)

[@Turbo87](https://github.com/turbo87/) announced the [release of version 5.0.0](https://twitter.com/TobiasBieniek/status/1103051224180498434) of [ember-ajax](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-ajax). In this update, we have a **breaking change** for the Error classes since the base class of the custom Error classes was changed to extend native `Error` instead of `EmberError`. 

Furthermore, ember-ajax was also updated to use [ember-cli-babel](https://github.com/babel/ember-cli-babel) v7.x, which requires all apps that uses ember-ajax to use [Ember CLI 2.13 or above](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-ajax#compatibility).

## [Full-Stack Development with Ember and Rails Livestream Series 📹](https://www.twitch.tv/codingitwrong)

Josh Justice AKA [@CodingItWrong](https://github.com/codingitwrong) has a new livestream series on his [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/codingitwrong) where he builds an application from scratch using Ember and Rails. Why Ember for this series? Productivity and developer happiness! 💯

These videos will appeal to you if...
* You're a backend developer who hasn't worked with extensive JavaScript before. You'll see how Ember allows you to build rich UIs, without needing to learn a lot to get started.
* You have experience with another frontend framework. You can learn from Ember's approach and gain another perspective.
* You've used Ember in the past. You'll be excited to see recent happenings that make Ember *easier* to use than before.

Check out the [teaser video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCjUBVNng4w) for the series, [Part 1: Deployment, CI, and Dependencies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Sz2AuhWKe0&t=), [Part 2: Models with JSON:API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA-dDw1Vqo), and [Part 3: UI Libraries and UX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnrUCCPego). More videos will be released on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa-4tbLDX_lmq2f40L0paZw) over the next few Fridays. Better yet, tune into the livestream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/codingitwrong) Fridays at 2pm ET to chat and follow along live!
