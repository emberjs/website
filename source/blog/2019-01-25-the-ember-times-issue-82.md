హలో Emberistas! 🐹

This week you can read all about a new RFC for **accesible routing** 🗺, angle brackets coming soon to the guides, a new way to decorate with Ember Decorators 🖼, a **contributor interview** with @bekzod 💬, check out the upcoming Ember.js documentary 🎬🍿🎥, a new RFC for **contextual helpers** 🎒 and more!

## [New RFC: Accessible Routing in Ember 🗺](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/433)
Currently, routing in Ember is not natively accessible for users with assistive technology. This means that whenever the user navigates to a new route within an Ember application, screen readers do not read out the new content or appropriately move focus. This new RFC by [@MelSumner](https://github.com/MelSumner) proposes a solution to this so **Ember routing can be natively accessible for users with assistive technology**.

Feel free to read the [RFC](https://github.com/MelSumner/rfcs/blob/MelSumner-a11y-routing/text/0000-a11y-routing.md) and leave your thoughts as a comment.

## [Coming Soon: Angle Brackets to the Guides 🎉](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues/139)

A [quest issue](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues/139) to convert the guides to **angle bracket invocation** is gaining traction. This effort will bring [RFC 311](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0311-angle-bracket-invocation.md) to the documentation in the next few weeks, which is nice since this is a feature that has been available in Ember for some time! Many thanks to the contributors involved in this effort. 👏

## [Decorate today! The Ember Way! 📍](http://ember-decorators.github.io/ember-decorators/)
[Ember Decorators](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0408-decorators.md) are the future of using Ember along with native Javascript classes. The addon [ember-decorators](https://github.com/ember-decorators/ember-decorators) allows you to use **"The Javascript of the Future, Today!"**
Once you install it you will have a fully RFC compliant implementation of Ember Decorators.
The [Ember Decorators RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0408-decorators.md) was merged into the RFC repo about two weeks ago. It will take some time until this functionality is in Ember Core.
If you would like to try this out now and give your feedback then install the addon and test it out!
Thanks to everyone for pushing this forward and making it a reality 🏆

## ["I contribute to Ember" with Bekzod Khaitbaev 💬](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/i-contribute-to-ember-with-bekzod-khaitbaev/16085)

This week we'd like to highlight the work of community member **Bekzod Khaitbaev**, also known as [@bekzod](https://github.com/bekzod). In an exclusive interview with the Ember Times he talk about his learnings as a **contributor** to the **Ember.js framework** and why contributions can have an impact on thousands of people.

## [Contextual Helpers 🆕](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/432)

The [Contextual Components pattern](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/components/wrapping-content-in-a-component/#toc_sharing-component-data-with-its-wrapped-content) empowered addon authors to create highly reusable UI components as part of popular addons such as [Ember Light Table](https://offirgolan.github.io/ember-light-table/), [Ember Power Calendar](https://ember-power-calendar.com/), [Ember Paper](https://miguelcobain.github.io/ember-paper/) and many more.

In extension of [allowing components to be contextual](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0064-contextual-component-lookup.html), a **new Request for Comments(RFC)**  proposes to [extend the semantics of template helpers in a similar fashion](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/contextual-helpers/text/0432-contextual-helpers.md).

You can read all about the motivation and possible design solutions in the original proposal and [leave your thoughts in the comments below](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/432)!
