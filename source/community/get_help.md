## Get Help

[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) is used to track questions. Just tag your question with `ember.js` or [search for questions with that tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ember.js). Please check to see if your question has already been answered before asking a new one.

There is also an IRC channel which can be found at `#emberjs` on Freenode. For more information on connecting to Freenode, please see [the Freenode website](http://www.freenode.net).

When asking questions or filing bugs, you can make it easier for community members to help you by providing a JSFiddle or JSBin demo that specifically shows your problem. This
demo should be fully operational with the exception of the issue you want to
demonstrate. The more pared down, the better. Preconfigured starting points: [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/6p6XJ/) | [JSBin](http://jsbin.com/ijicor/3/edit)
