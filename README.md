## Ember Website
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/emberjs/website.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/emberjs/website)

The website for the Ember.js project.

### Contributing

To get started:

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/emberjs/website.git
cd website
bundle
bundle exec middleman
```

Then visit [http://localhost:4567/](http://localhost:4567/)

**Note**: unless you're working with the API docs, don't use `rake preview`â€”use `middleman` (aka `middleman server`) instead.

To populate organizers data from meetup.com on [http://localhost:4567/meetups](http://localhost:4567/meetups)

  * get a [meetup API Key](https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/)
  * set `ENV["MEETUP_API_KEY"]`
  * run the following rake command

``` sh
rake findorganizers [force=true]

The force=true flag will overwrite all existing organizer data
```

#### API Documentation

You can preview the API documentation by generating the docs from the source code. To begin, ensure
that you have the necessary dependencies:

- Node
- npm
- Ruby
- bundler

Next, clone the three repositories: [`ember.js`](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js),
[`data`](https://github.com/emberjs/data), and this repository, `website`. The repositories need
to be placed in the same directory:

    emberjs/
        website/
        ember.js/
        ember-data/

Note that the name of the data project needs to be `ember-data`, not `data`.

Next, do a `git checkout` of the particular commit or tag you wish to generate
documentation for. For example, to generate documentation for v2.13 you would
run `git checkout v2.13.0` in both the `ember.js` and `ember-data` directories.

Last, navigate into the root directory of this repository and execute `bundle exec rake generate_docs`. This
will build the documentation for the `ember.js` and `data` repositories.

You can launch the website via `bundle exec middleman` to preview the generated docs.
To deploy, open a PR with the changes resulting from `generate_docs` and the
change will be auto-deployed upon merge.

### Requirements

If the `bundle` command is not found, you can install it with `gem install bundle`.

If the `bundle` command fails to run, you may need to upgrade your Ruby version. Please check the current supported version that described at [.ruby-version](https://github.com/emberjs/website/blob/master/.ruby-version).
You can use [RVM](https://rvm.io/) to install it:

``` sh
$ curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
$ rvm install $(cat .ruby-version)
$ rvm use $(cat .ruby-version)
```

### Troubleshooting tips for Windows devs

For Windows developers using [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/), you'll need to [download the DevKit](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads) and install it using instructions:
https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit

After you have a proper install, you can then run:
``` sh
gem install bundler wdm tzinfo-data
gem update listen middleman
```

Once Middleman comes up, you'll be prompted by Windows Firewall. Click "Allow access" and you'll be in business!
